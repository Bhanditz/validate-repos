It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n## Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n"

        "contributing": "We're really happy to accept contributions to the mdn-browser-compat-data repository!\nThis file lists some general guidelines to help you contributing effectively.\n\n## Types of contribution\n\nThere are many ways you can help improve this repository! For example:\n\n* **Adding new compat data**: familiarize yourself with the [schema](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/schemas/compat-data.schema.json) and read the [schema docs](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/schemas/compat-data-schema.md) to add new files.\n* **Fixing existing compat data**: maybe a browser now supports a certain feature. Yay! If you open a PR to fix a browser's data, it would be most helpful if you include a link to a bug report or similar so that we can double-check the good news.\n* **Fixing a bug:** we have a list of [issues](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/issues),\nor maybe you found your own.\n* **Reviewing a pull request:** there is a list of [PRs](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pulls).\nLet us know if these look good to you.\n* **Publishing a new package (staff only):** A new npm package should be published regularly, [see below](#publishing-a-new-package-version) for details.\n\n## Validating the data\nYou can use `npm test` to validate data against the schema. You might need to install the devDependencies using `npm install`.\nThe JSON data is validated against the schema using [`ajv`](http://epoberezkin.github.io/ajv/).\n\n### Optional: Validate/cross-reference against Web API Confluence Dashboard\nIf the feature you're interested in is a JavaScript API, you can cross-reference data against the [Web API Confluence Dashboard](https://web-confluence.appspot.com/) using the `confluence` npm script. This script will overwrite data in your current working tree according to data from the dashboard.\n\n**Note: Web API Confluence Dashboard data should not be regarded as perfect knowledge of JavaScript APIs.**\nThe dashboard derives its data from the JavaScript object graph on a sample page loaded in each browser. For example, an own property named `URL` on `Document.prototype` implies the \"`Document` interface has a member named `URL`. For various reasons, not all APIs are exposed on JavaScript prototypes, even when the API is available in the browser.\n\nExamples:\n\n```shell\n# Load confluence data for ServiceWorker\nnpm run confluence -- --interfaces=ServiceWorker\n\n# Fill in missing/ambiguous Firefox data on known interfaces\nnpm run confluence -- --browsers=firefox --fill-only\n\n# Print documentation on full list of options\nnpm run confluence -- --help\n```\n\n## Test rendering\nYou can use `npm run render $query $dept $aggregateMode` to output the table HTML as it would be rendered on MDN.\nThe parameters are the same as the [`{{compat}}` macro](https://github.com/mdn/kumascript/blob/master/macros/Compat.ejs).\n\nPaste the generated HTML into the MDN editor (source mode). You can use a new page, for example: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/new and verify if the output looks correct.\n\n## Checklist\nNot everything is enforced or validated by the schema. A few things to pay attention to:\n\n* Feature identifiers (the data namespaces, like `css.properties.background`) should make sense and are spelled correctly.\n* Nesting of feature identifiers should make sense.\n* Notes use correct grammar and spelling. They should be complete sentences ending with a period.\n\n## Code style\n\nThe JSON files should be formatted according to the [.editorconfig](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/.editorconfig) file.\n\n\n## Publishing a new package version\n\nRegularly, a new release of [mdn-browser-compat-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdn-browser-compat-data) is created by MDN staff and will then be [deployed to the MDN site](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data#browser-compatibility-tables-on-mdn). Usually this is done every Thursday (MDN never deploys to production on Fridays). Releases should be coordinated with the project owner [Florian Scholz](https://github.com/Elchi3), but anyone with merge permissions on the mdn/browser-compat-data repository has the ability to run the following steps which will create a new package version:\n\n 1. Figure out the new version number by looking at [past releases](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/releases). The project is in alpha, so we're using only patch versions. Lets assume the next version should be `0.0.43`.\n 2. On your updated and clean master branch, run `npm version patch -m \"43rd alpha version\"`. Locally, this updates `package.json`, creates a new commit, and creates a new release tag (see also the docs for [npm version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version)).\n 3. Push the commit to master: `git push origin master`.\n 4. Check if the commit passes fine on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/mdn/browser-compat-data).\n 5. If Travis is alright, push the git tag as well: `git push origin v0.0.43`.\n This step will trigger Travis to publish to npm automatically (see our [.travis.yml file](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/.travis.yml)).\n 6. Check [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/mdn/browser-compat-data) again for the v0.0.43 build and also check [mdn-browser-compat-data on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mdn-browser-compat-data) to see if `0.0.43` shows up correctly once Travis has finished its work.\n 7. Notify the [#mdndev](irc://irc.mozilla.org/mdndev) IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org about the new release and coordinate with jwhitlock or rjohnson a deployment of the new package to the MDN site.\n 8. Create a [new release on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/releases) and write down release notes. Mention notable changes if non-data updates happened (schema, test, or infrastructure changes). Also record current statistics such as total number of contributors and stargazers, as well as the total number of features by running this node command in the main dir:\n `node -p \"bcd=require('.');i=0;JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(bcd),function(k,v){if(k==='__compat'){i++;}return i;})\"`\n\n Release notes template:\n ```\nNotable changes:\n- [TK text]\n\nStatistics:\n- [TK number] contributors have changed [TK number] files with [TK number] additions and [TK number] deletions in [TK number] commits [TK link to diff between version tags]\n- [TK number] total contributors\n- [TK number] total stargazers\n- [TK number] total features\n```\n\n## Licensing\n\nPlease note that the compatibility data is made available under the\n[CC0 license](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/master/LICENSE),\nso any contributions must be compatible with that license. If you're not sure about that, just ask.\n\n## Getting help\n\nIf you need help with this repository or have any questions, contact the MDN team\nin the [#mdn](irc://irc.mozilla.org/mdn) IRC channel on irc.mozilla.org or write us on [discourse](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/c/mdn).\n"

[Find an existing issue](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues) directly related to the contribution\n  2. [Add a new issue](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/new)\n\nIssues are where individual reports and Working Group discussions come together such \nthat the eventual consensus can be turned into official specification language.\n\nIf you are familiar with a [GitHub-based pull request contribution workflow](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/), \nplease note that **most issues are subject to quite a bit of discussion** before \nthey are ready for a pull request with specific wording changes. Please ensure\nthe full problem space of the issue is explored in the discussion, and that\nconsensus has been reached by the participants, before drafting a pull request.\n\n## Normative and/or substantive contributions\n\nThe CSS Working Group operates via the consensus of its membership, and discusses \nall significant matters prior to implementation.\n\nThe Editors responsible for a particular spec are responsible for triaging their\nissues on a regular basis; however note that sometimes this can take awhile\n(anywhere from a few days to a few years) depending on the complexity of the\nissue and the work schedules of people involved--this does not mean we are\nignoring the issue.\n\nFor an issue that requires WG discussion or approval, WG members can tag/label\nit 'Agenda+' to bring it to the Working Group's attention. Unfortunately,\nGitHub doesn't allow labelling permissions without repository write permissions,\nso if you believe an issue is urgent or discussion has stalled for awhile and\nthe WG's attention is needed to move forward, ask one of the editors to flag it.\n\nThe Working Group, aside from managing issues on GitHub, mainly discusses\nspecifications and requests on [the www-style public mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/),\nand in CSSWG meetings, whose minutes are posted to www-style.\n\n### After discussion\n\nOnce the Working Group has come to a consensus, the editor may draft up and\ncommit the relevant changes for review by other contributors or a contributor\nmay file a pull request against the issue for review by the editor(s). Since\nspecification wording is tricky, it is strongly recommended that the editors\nof that particular spec be involved, either as originator or as reviewer, in\nany changes. We also encourage other participants in the issue discussion to\nreview the changes and request corrections or improvements as necessary.\n\nPlease follow the [Pull Request template](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) \nwhen contributing to the repository.\n\n### Tests\n\nFor normative changes for any specification in\n[CR or later](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work) as well as the pre-CR specifications listed\nbelow, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) PR must be\nprovided, except if testing is not practical; for other specifications it is usually appreciated.\n\nTypically, both PRs will be merged at the same time.

Here are a few ways you can help make this project better!\n\n## Talk with us\n\nTalk with us directly on IRC. Here are some [detailed instructions to connect](http://www.w3.org/Project/IRC/). The server is `irc.w3.org` and the corresponding channel is `#pub`. If you do not have an IRC client on hand, you can log into the [W3C Public IRC Web Client](http://irc.w3.org/).\n\nDiscuss the publication workflow and related tools [on the mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/spec-prod/).\n\n## Report a bug or suggest a feature idea\n\nStart by looking through the [existing bugs](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/issues) to see if this was already discussed earlier. You might even find your solution there.\n\nRemember to update [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) often, and the npm dependencies of the project too.\n\nIf you do not find anything, you can help report bugs by [filing them here](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/issues/new). Please use the following template when doing so:\n\n```markdown\n##### Issue Type\n\nCan you help us out in labelling this by telling us what kind of ticket this this?\nYou can say \"Bug Report\", \"Feature Idea\" or \"Documentation Report\".\n\n##### Summary\n\nPlease summarize your request in this space. You will earn bonus points for being\nsuccinct, but please add enough detail so we can understand the request. Thanks!\n\n##### Steps To Reproduce\n\nIf this is a bug ticket, please enter the steps you use to reproduce the problem\nin the space below. If this is a feature request, please enter the steps you would\nuse to use the feature. If an example document is useful, please include its URL.\n\n##### Expected Results\n\nPlease enter your expected results in this space. When running the steps supplied\nabove in the previous section, what did you expect to happen? If showing example\noutput, please surround it with 3 backticks before and after so that it's rendered\ncorrectly.\n\n##### Actual Results\n\nPlease enter your actual results in this space. When running the steps supplied\nabove, what actually happened? If showing example output, please surround it with\n3 backticks before and after so that it's rendered correctly.\n```\n\n## Contribute to the code\n\nFirst of all, thank you very much for offering your help. This is much appreciated.\n\nBefore adding a new feature or submitting a bugfix, please refer to the [existing issues](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/issues) to check if it was already discussed before. If it wasn't, please [create a new one](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/issues/new) so that we can discuss together about it before you start coding. It would be frustrating for everyone if we had to refuse your contribution because we did not share the same opinion!\n\nTo make sure we are on the same page, you should refer to our [coding style guide](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki/Coding-style-guide) and [coding practices guide](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki/Coding-practices-guide) before coding.\n\nFinally, we value testing a lot. Before committing anything, make sure the style is respected and the test suite passes by running `npm test`. If you submit a bugfix, try to write tests to reproduce this bug to ensure the same bug will not come up again in the future. And if you submit a new feature, provide tests to ensure the correct behavior of the nominal and edge cases.\n\nA couple of things you should consider before committing and [opening a pull request](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/pulls):\n\n- Regarding your Git commit messages:\n  - Use imperative present tense for commit messages as [suggested in the official documentation](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project#Commit-Guidelines).\n  - When commiting a bug fix, start your line with \"Fix #xx\", xx being the issue number. For example: `git commit -m 'Fix #42: Answer the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything'`\n- To ease the merge of pull requests, make sure your branch is up-to-date with `master` when submitting it. Always use `git rebase` instead of `git merge` and `git pull --rebase` instead of `git pull` to avoid merge commits in your submissions.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation can be found on [the wiki](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki). You can help us improving it by adding missing pieces, clarifying unclear parts, or asking us to do that.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nAll contributors to this project agree to follow the [W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nIf you want to take action, you can contact W3C Staff as explained in [W3C Procedures](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/pwe/#Procedures).\n"

It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n##Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n"

It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n## Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n"

You may also want to read [how the spec is built](https://github.com/w3c/html/blob/master/docs/build-documentation.md).\n\nEditorial improvements are welcome, just make a [Pull Request (PR)](https://github.com/w3c/html/pulls)! You may encounter a warning about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) commitments if you are not a member of the W3C [Web Platform Working Group (WebPlat WG)](https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/), but this will be handled by the WebPlat WG editorial team. Specific concerns about IPR and the W3C may be found in the [Intellectual Rights FAQ](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620.html).\n\nYour concern might already be known. Before beginning work, check [the issue tracker](https://github.com/w3c/html/issues) to see if there are any existing discussions about the issue. If you want to help but are unsure how to begin, some issues are marked as [good first issues](https://github.com/w3c/html/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or [help wanted](https://github.com/w3c/html/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). These might be good places to start. \n\nProposals for new elements are best discussed on the [WICG Discourse](https://discourse.wicg.io/).\n\nTo make **substantive** contributions, changes that clarify or update conformance requirements, you must either participate in the W3C [Web Platform Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/) or make a [non-member patent licensing commitment](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/83482/nmlc). \nThis is because the W3C Patent Policy depends on granting licenses for the [essential claims](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/#def-essential) needed to implement the spec. A list of [previous substantive contributions](https://github.com/w3c/html/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aclosed+label%3Asubstantive) can be found on the issue tracker.\n\nIf your contribution includes the work of others, please see [Contributing Documentation](https://github.com/w3c/html/blob/master/docs/contributing-documentation.md) for further guidance.\n\n## Tests\n\nFor **substantive changes**, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests) PR is highly appreciated. The W3C defines a normative change as edits that affect the formal part of the Recommendation, rules that everyone must follow. **Non-substantive** changes affect supplementary information and guidance for these rules.\n\nTypically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why and if appropriate [file an issue](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/new) to follow up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.\n\n## Language and Terminology\n\nIt may help to familiarize yourself with the specific language used by the W3C HTML Recommendation. A [full Index of terms](https://w3c.github.io/html/fullindex.html#index) used by the specification is available, as well as a [Manual of Style](https://w3c.github.io/manual-of-style/).\n"

In the commit, please include on a new line,\n<pre>Contributors: +@githubusername1, +@githubusername2, ...</pre>\n\n### Line Wrapping\n\n#### Recommendations\nFormat new text to break each line within 80 characters. If you add a few new words to an existing paragraph, it's OK if that line exceeds 80 characters. If fixing the width means that the next line gets to wide, and so on, it's better to leave it since touching a lot of lines unrelated to the actual fix makes the PR harder to review. We will make automatic re-flows of the document every once in a while.\n\n#### Automatic Formatting\nYou can use [webrtc-respec-ci](https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-respec-ci) to automatically format your code. Note that this script formats the entire document and may change lines that are not part of your original patch. This can make your changes harder to review.\n\n1. Follow the instructions on \"Local use\" to setup the scripts.\n2. Run: ```make -f ../webrtc-respec-ci/Makefile linewrap LINEWRAPLENGTH=80```.\n\n### Pull Request Names\nChoose a name for your PR that would make sense in a change log.  \nExample: Add support for new attribute X on Y (fixes: #123).  \nAvoid: Fix for #123.\n\n### Linked Names\nMake names of interfaces, enums and other identifiers clickable like this ```<code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>```.\n\n### Refactoring: Moving Text\nIf your PR needs to both move a section of text and update it, please do these operations in two separate commits (or even PRs). That will make the review process simpler.\n\n### Run Linter on Examples\nIf you have made a lot of changes to the example code snippets it might be a good idea to run the example linter. For instructions, see https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-respec-ci/blob/master/check-examples/README.md\n"

It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n## Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n"

It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n##Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n"

It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n## Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n"

This transforms the source content\ninto a set of static HTML pages which can then be served using any\nwebserver.\n\n## Deployment in Production\n\nThe production copy of this website is located at\n[testthewebforward.org domain][testtwf-org]. It is hosted on\n[GitHub][github-io]. In order to build the static copy of the website,\na [travis][travis] script is run on each commit to the master branch. This\nperforms the build steps and pushes the result to a second repository\ncontaining only the output HTML and other assets.\n\n### Testing Changes Locally\n\nBuilding the tests locally requires [Ruby][ruby] and\n[Ruby Gems][gems]. These are installed by default on many systems; if\nthey are not present on your system they can be installed using your\npackage manager or via the installers downloadable on their websites.\n\nIf it not already installed the `bundler` program should then be\ninstalled using\n\n    $ gem install bundler\n\nThe dependencies can then be installed using the `bundle` command:\n\n    $ bundle install\n\nIf you are running Xcode 5.1 or over and get the following error when installing,\n\n    clang: error: unknown argument: '-multiply_definedsuppress' [-Wunused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future]\n\nthis is [a known issue][jekyll-clang-bug] and you will need to install jekyll\nwith the following command. (You may need to do this from a superuser shell.)\n\n    $ ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future gem install github-pages\n\nThis will also install `rake`, a `make`-like tool that defines a\nnumber of targets corresponding to useful operations. To start a local\nserver use `rake serve`\n\n    $ rake serve\n\nOnce this has finished building, navigate your browser to\n`http://localhost:4000` to see the site.\n\nModifications to the source code get automatically picked-up and\ndisplayed on page refresh.\n\n## Documentation format\n\nDocumentation should be written using [Markdown][markdown]. It will be\ntransformed into HTML during the build process.\n\nTo ease online review, lines should be no longer than 80 characters. This is\ngreatly simplified by using [reference style links][ref-style] placed at the\nbottom of the page. For example (lifted off John Gruber's\n[Markdown Syntax guide][markdown]):\n\n    This is [an example][eg] reference-style link.\n\n    [...]\n\n    Then, anywhere in the document (usually at the end), you define your link\n    label like this, on a line by itself:\n\n    [eg]: http://example.com/\n\nFavor named referenced over indexed ones, as those make refactoring much\nsimpler.\n\nAs an added benefit, this syntax makes keeping links up to date a\nlot easier as they are all placed together at the bottom of the page.\n\n## Blog post format\n\nBlog post should be written using either HTML or [Markdown][markdown]. In Jekyll,\nblog posts are just regular text files which get treated differently when\nfollowing a few simple conventions (mainly file names and directory structure)\nas described in the [online documentation][jekyll-blog].\n\nAll blog posts must be located in the `_posts` directory and must use the `post`\ntemplate (which should be specified in the [YAML front-matter][front-matter]).\n\nBlog posts can be of three different types. Regular, in depth posts should use the\n`post` type, shorter posts, the `quickpost` type, and `newsletter` posts… the\n`newsletter` type. Types are added using [YAML front-matter][front-matter].\n\nNote that posts of type `post` will have data pulled from the `people` database\nlocated in the [site-wide config file][config] in order to populate their \"about the\nauthor section\".\n\nAlso noteworthy is the ability to signal when posts have been cross-posted elsewhere.\nThis can be done using the `x-post` property in the [YAML front-matter][front-matter].\n\n## Event page format\n\nEvent pages should be written in HTML. A lot of the content is automatically\ngenerated from data placed in the [YAML front-matter][front-matter]. This\nincludes:\n\n* name of the city (`city`, and `localized_city` fields),\n* date of the event (`date`, and `localized_date` fields),\n* title of the page (optional `title` field),\n* list of event sponsors (`sponsors` field),\n* list of event speakers (`speakers` field), and\n* list of event experts (`experts` field).\n\nSetting the language of the page (`lang` field) can help automatically\nlocalize some of the above.\n\nThere are good examples of how to author this YAML front-matter in the\n[page for the Seattle event][event-eg].\n\nThe `sponsors`, `speakers` and `experts` field simply pull data out of the\n[site-wide config file][config] (a poor man's db) which they run through\n[templates][templates] to produce markup. So for example:\n\n``` yaml\n---\nlang: zho\nspeakers: [Rebecca Hauck]\n---\n```\n\nwill automatically create the following HTML markup:\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"speakers\">\n  <h2 id=\"speakers\">专家</h2>\n  <div class=\"media col-md-4\">\n    <img class=\"media-object thumbnail pull-left\" width=\"48\" height=\"48\"\n      src=\"/assets/experts/rhauck.jpg\" alt=\"Picture of Rebecca Hauck\">\n    <h4 class=\"media-heading\">Rebecca Hauck</h4>\n       <p>Adobe, CSS Working Group</p>\n    </li>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nNote that while sponsors get automatically added to the end of the events page,\nspeakers and experts need to be included via an `include tag` at the desired\nlocation. E.g.:\n\n``` html\n<p>Some content goes here:</p>\n\n{% include events/speakers.html %}\n\n<p>All talks will be given in English.</p>\n\n{% include events/experts.html %}\n```\n\nShould you need to modify or add a speaker, expert or sponsor, please do so in\nthe [config file][config].

Note that speakers and experts share the same `people` entry.\n\n## File names\n\nFile names should be lowercased, hyphenated and use the `.md` extension for\n[Markdown](markdown)-formated content (e.g.: `review-process.md`).

By committing here, you agree to that licensing of your contributions.\n\nIf you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all contributors in the pull request comment.\n\nTo add a contributor (other than yourself, that's automatic), mark them one per line as follows:\n\n```\n+@github_username\n```\n\nIf you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:\n\n```\n-@github_username\n```\n\nIf you are making a pull request on behalf of someone else but you had no part in designing the feature, you can remove yourself with the above syntax.\n\n\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright is a very important part of standardization activities. It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n## Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n"

Please read the material below, and get involved as explained. \n\nIf you have any questions, please [raise an issue](/../../issues).\n\n## Simple Editorial Changes\nFor simple editorial changes, please feel free to raise a `pull request` or [raise an issue](/../../issues) on this repository. A simple editorial change can be things like spelling and grammar mistakes, broken links, and so on.\n\nSome changes may appear simple but may actually be more complicated than they appear. Don't worry - please continue to send your `pull request` or [raise an issue](/../../issues) and we can discuss. \n\n## The W3C Process Community Group\nThe W3C runs a [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/), which is an open group created to manage discussions on developing the [W3C Process Document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/). Some suggestions for changes to the [W3C Process Document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/) will need to be made within the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/), please see information below as to whether you need to take your suggestions to the group or can just raise a `pull request` or `issue`.\n\n## Changes that Affect the Way the W3C Operates but Do Not Change the Policy\nFor changes that affect the way that the W3C operates but do not change policy please do the following:\n\n* [Raise an issue](/../../issues) on this repo\n* Make sure the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) adds the issue to its agenda. This will allow you to explain why you think this is an improvement to the operation of the W3C (it's probably not helpful to provide a Pull Request until you have consensus on the approach).\n\nThe best way to ensure your issue gets added to the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) agenda is to add yourself to the group, please visit [the group homepage](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) and select the button \"Join or Leave this Group\".\n\nAnother way to ensure the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) addressed your issue is to check back on the [issues page](/../../issues) page and ask whether it has been addressed. It is more effective to join the group, but you have this option if you need it. \n\nThe [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) will discuss your issue, and decide whether the change can be made or whether the issue needs to be brought to the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#AB) or [Advisory Committee](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#AC) for discussion; see the next section for more information on this process.\n\nIf the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) agrees the issue does not change the policy and agrees to make the changes detailed in your issue, you may either raise a `pull request` or wait for the Editor to make the required changes. Note: raising a `pull request` **will** be faster. See more details about `pull requests` below.\n\n## Changes that Affect the Way the W3C Operates and Change the Policy\nFor changes that represent a change of policy in the W3C, the idea will need to be brought to the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/2002/ab/) or [Advisory Committee](https://www.w3.org/participate/meetings). Again, a Pull Request can wait until you have gained consensus with these two committees.\n\nYou can raise the issue with the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/), and you can suggest (or they will notice) that it needs policy discussion and refer it onwards. But you may prefer to initiate that discussion yourself.\n\nGetting something in front of both the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#AB) or [Advisory Committee](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#AC) can be tricky. If your organisation is a W3C member please let your Advisory Committee member know; they will then be able to email the Advisory Committee or bring the issue up at an Advisory Committee meeting. To reach the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/2002/ab/) you can [raise an issue](/../../issues) on this repo (at least two AB members monitor this repo) or send an email to ab@w3.org.\n\nGaining consensus from the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/2002/ab/) or [Advisory Committee](https://www.w3.org/participate/meetings) will take some time. After consensus has been reached you may either raise a `pull request` which include the changes agreed by these committees or wait for the Editor to make the required changes. See more details about `pull requests` below.\n\n## Edit and Pull Request Instructions\nThis is a very simple repository. To make an edit to the document simply edit the [index.html](index.html) file and send a pull request when your changes are done. If you have the rights to edit this repo your edits will need to be made on a new branch. If you do not have the rights to edit this repo please `fork` the repo, make your edits, then send a `pull request`.\n\nPull Requests should result in a correct-looking document (formats and lays out correctly).\n\n## Notes\nPlease feel free to suggest how this document can improve by [raising an issue](/../../issues) on this repo.\n"

Please follow them and we will be able to review your PR a lot faster when we don't have to point out style and other non-technical issues. Thank you.\n\n### W3C Legal\nContributions to this repository are intended to become part of Recommendation-track documents governed by the\n[W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and\n[Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents). To bring substantive contributions to specifications, you must either participate\nin the relevant W3C Working Group or make a non-member patent licensing commitment.\n\nIf you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all contributors in the \ncommit message. In the commit, please include on a new line,\n<pre>Contributors: +@githubusername1, +@githubusername2, ...</pre>\n\n### 80 Characters\nFormat new text to break each line within 80 characters. If you add a few new words to an existing paragraph, it's OK if that line exceeds 80 characters. If fixing the width means that the next line gets to wide, and so on, it's better to leave it since touching a lot of lines unrelated to the actual fix makes the PR harder to review. We will make automatic re-flows of the document every once in a while.\n\n### Pull Request Names\nChoose a name for your PR that would make sense in a change log.  \nExample: Add support for new attribute X on Y (fixes: #123).  \nAvoid: Fix for #123.\n\n### Linked Names\nMake names of interfaces, enums and other identifiers clickable like this ```<code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>```.\n\n### JSEP References\nReference specific sections of JSEP where possible. The syntax looks like this:  \n```<span data-jsep=\"initial-offers initial-answers\">[[!JSEP]]</span>```  \nSection aliases, to be used as data-jsep values, are found in [jsep-mapping/map.json](jsep-mapping/map.json). Information on how to update the map is found in [jsep-mapping/README.md](jsep-mapping/README.md).\n\n### Refactoring: Moving Text\nIf your PR needs to both move a section of text and update it, please do these operations in two separate commits (or even PRs). That will make the review process simpler.\n\n### Run Linter on Examples\nIf you have made a lot of changes to the example code snippets it might be a good idea to run the example linter. For instructions, see https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-respec-ci/blob/master/check-examples/README.md\n\n### Style Conventions\n\n**Strings**. Use quotes and enclose in code tags (to distinguish strings literals from quoted prose).\nExample: `<code>\"String literal\"</code>`\n\n**Booleans**. Enclose booleans in code tags (without quotes).\\\nExample: `<code>true</code>`\n\n**Enum Values**. See **Strings**.\n\n**Notes**. Use div tags for notes.\\\nExample: `<div class='note'>FYI</div>`\n\n**Internal Slots**. Use upper camel case (initial upper case letter) with a leading backslash and enclosed by two brackets. The leading backslash prevents the text in double brackets from being interpreted as a reference. If a slot name is very general, like \"Id\", it might be useful to add more information to it to avoid name collisions and make it easier to identify its owning entity. For example, \"Id\" could be extended to \"ComponentId\".\\\nExample (defining): `<dfn>[[\\FooBar]]</dfn>`\\\nExample (referencing): `<a>[[\\FooBar]]</a>`\n\n### Tests\nFor normative changes, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) PR is highly appreciated. Typically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why and if appropriate [file a web-platform-tests issue](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/new) to follow up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.\n"

        "contributing": "Since we are a lot of people contributing to the specification, we have defined a few guidelines. Please follow them and we will be able to review your PR a lot faster when we don't have to point out style and other non-technical issues. Thank you.\n\n### W3C Legal\nContributions to this repository are intended to become part of Recommendation-track documents governed by the\n[W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and\n[Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents). To bring substantive contributions to specifications, you must either participate\nin the relevant W3C Working Group or make a non-member patent licensing commitment.\n\nIf you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all contributors in the \ncommit message. In the commit, please include on a new line,\n<pre>Contributors: +@githubusername1, +@githubusername2, ...</pre>\n\n### 80 Characters\nFormat new text to break each line within 80 characters. If you add a few new words to an existing paragraph, it's OK if that line exceeds 80 characters. If fixing the width means that the next line gets to wide, and so on, it's better to leave it since touching a lot of lines unrelated to the actual fix makes the PR harder to review. We will make automatic re-flows of the document every once in a while.\n\n### Pull Request Names\nChoose a name for your PR that would make sense in a change log.  \nExample: Add support for new attribute X on Y (fixes: #123).  \nAvoid: Fix for #123.\n\n### Linked Names\nMake names of interfaces, enums and other identifiers clickable like this ```<code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>```.\n\n### JSEP References\nReference specific sections of JSEP where possible. The syntax looks like this:  \n```<span data-jsep=\"initial-offers initial-answers\">[[!JSEP]]</span>```  \nSection aliases, to be used as data-jsep values, are found in [jsep-mapping/map.json](jsep-mapping/map.json). Information on how to update the map is found in [jsep-mapping/README.md](jsep-mapping/README.md).\n\n### Refactoring: Moving Text\nIf your PR needs to both move a section of text and update it, please do these operations in two separate commits (or even PRs). That will make the review process simpler.\n\n### Run Linter on Examples\nIf you have made a lot of changes to the example code snippets it might be a good idea to run the example linter. For instructions, see https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-respec-ci/blob/master/check-examples/README.md\n\n### Style Conventions\n\n**Strings**. Use quotes and enclose in code tags (to distinguish strings literals from quoted prose).\nExample: `<code>\"String literal\"</code>`\n\n**Booleans**. Enclose booleans in code tags (without quotes).\\\nExample: `<code>true</code>`\n\n**Enum Values**. See **Strings**.\n\n**Notes**. Use div tags for notes.\\\nExample: `<div class='note'>FYI</div>`\n\n**Internal Slots**. Use upper camel case (initial upper case letter) with a leading backslash and enclosed by two brackets. The leading backslash prevents the text in double brackets from being interpreted as a reference. If a slot name is very general, like \"Id\", it might be useful to add more information to it to avoid name collisions and make it easier to identify its owning entity. For example, \"Id\" could be extended to \"ComponentId\".\\\nExample (defining): `<dfn>[[\\FooBar]]</dfn>`\\\nExample (referencing): `<a>[[\\FooBar]]</a>`\n\n### Tests\nFor normative changes, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) PR is highly appreciated. Typically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why and if appropriate [file a web-platform-tests issue](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/new) to follow up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.\n"

Should any part of the\nLicense for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under\napplicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not\ninvalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby\naffirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims\nand causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to\nAffirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n4.

The Purpose and General Terms of this Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This CLA sets forth the terms under which I will participate in and contribute to the development of the Specification, if any, created by the Project. Any other capitalized terms not specifically defined herein have the same meaning as those terms have in the [W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent/), and if not defined there, in the [W3C Process Document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/). Any source code created by the Project is not subject to this CLA, but rather subject to separate licensing terms for that source code. The W3C [Community and Business Group Process](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/) governs the operations of the Project. The Community and Business Group Process delegates some rights to the participants of the Project to establish operational agreements. Those operational agreements must not conflict with or modify this Community and Business Group Process, the [Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/cla), or the [Final Specification Agreement](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/final). Except for the limited definitions specifically referenced herein, this CLA and the Final Specification Agreement, if I sign it, set forth my entire licensing obligations for Specifications created by the Project and supersede all prior negotiations, agreements, understandings, and obligations with respect thereto.\n2.  2\\. Copyrights.\n    1.  2.1. Copyright Grant. I grant to you a perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright), worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, copyright license, without any obligation for accounting to me, to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, distribute, and implement any Contribution to the full extent of my copyright interest in the Contribution.\n    2.  2.2. Attribution. As a condition of the copyright grant, you must include an attribution to the Specification in any derivative work you make based on the Specification. That attribution must include, at minimum, the Specification name and version number.\n3.  3\\. Patents.\n    1.  3.1. Patent Licensing Commitment. I agree to license my Essential Claims under the W3C CLA RF Licensing Requirements. This requirement includes Essential Claims that I own and any that I have the right to license without obligation of payment or other consideration to an unrelated third party. With the exception of the provisions of Section 5 below, W3C CLA RF Licensing Requirements obligations made concerning the Specification and described in this CLA are binding on me for the life of the patents in question and encumber the patents containing Essential Claims, regardless of changes in participation status or W3C Membership. I also agree to license my Essential Claims under the W3C CLA RF Licensing Requirements in derivative works of the Specification developed by the Project, provided that my Contribution remains intact in those derivative works. However, no additional claims are made Essential Claims in the combination of my Contribution with derivative works of the Specification.\n    2.  3.2. Optional, Additional Patent Grant. In addition to the provisions of Section 3.1, I may also, at my option, make certain intellectual property rights infringed by implementations of the Specification, including Essential Claims, available by providing those terms via the W3C Web site.\n4.  4\\. No Other Rights. Except as specifically set forth in this CLA, no other express or implied patent, trademark, copyright, or other property rights are granted under this CLA, including by implication, waiver, or estoppel.\n5.  5\\. Limited Opt-Out. I, in my sole discretion, may withdraw my Contribution, for any reason, by providing written notice of that withdrawal no later than 45 days after the date of my Contribution. Notice of withdrawal of a Contribution must be made in writing using the Project's communications mechanisms for that purpose and must describe the exact material of the particular Contribution being withdrawn. Upon providing that notice, the identified Contribution will be deemed null and void, and, not withstanding anything to the contrary herein, I will not be deemed to have incurred any obligation with respect to that Contribution. In addition, any particular Contribution will be null and void, and I will not incur any obligation as a result of it, if that Contribution is not included in the Specification within 150 days of the date of that Contribution.\n6.  6\\. W3C Community Contributor License Agreement Execution. I acknowledge that the goal of this CLA is to provide coverage for Contributions to the Specification, if any, created by the Project. The Final Specification itself, if any, will be subject to the [W3C Community Final Specification Agreement](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/final). While I have no legal obligation to execute the W3C Community Final Specification Agreement for any version of the Specification being developed under this CLA, I agree that the selection and terms of the then current W3C Community Final Specification Agreement will not be subject to negotiation.\n7.  7\\. Antitrust Compliance. I acknowledge that I may compete with other participants, that I am under no obligation to implement the Specification, that each participant is free to develop competing technologies and standards, and that each party is free to license its patent rights to third parties, including for the purpose of enabling competing technologies and standards.\n8.  8\\. Non-Circumvention. I agree that I will not intentionally take or willfully assist any third party to take any action for the purpose of circumventing my obligations under this CLA.\n9.  9\\. Transition to W3C Recommendation Track. Specifications developed by the Project may transition to the W3C Recommendation Track. The W3C Team is responsible for notifying me that a Corresponding Working Group has been chartered. I have no obligation to join the Corresponding Working Group. If the Specification developed under the Project transitions to the W3C Recommendation Track, the following terms apply:\n    1.  9.1. If I join the Corresponding Working Group. If I join the Corresponding Working Group, I will be subject to all W3C rules, obligations, licensing commitments, and policies that govern that Corresponding Working Group.\n    2.  9.2. If I Do Not Join the Corresponding Working Group.\n        1.  9.2.1. Licensing Obligations to Resulting Specification. If I do not join the Corresponding Working Group, I agree to offer patent licenses according to the W3C Royalty-Free licensing requirements described in Section 5 of the W3C Patent Policy for my Contributions included in the resulting Recommendation. This licensing commitment may not be revoked but may be modified through the exclusion process defined in Section 4 of the W3C Patent Policy. I am not required to join a Working Group to exclude patents from the W3C Royalty-Free licensing commitment, but must otherwise follow the normal exclusion procedures defined by the W3C Patent Policy. The W3C Team will notify me of any Call for Exclusion in the Corresponding Working Group as set forth in Section 4.5 of the W3C Patent Policy.\n        2.  9.2.2. No Disclosure Obligation. If I do not join the Corresponding Working Group, I have no patent disclosure obligations outside of those set forth in Section 6 of the W3C Patent Policy.\n10. 10\\. Conflict of Interest. I will disclose significant relationships when those relationships might reasonably be perceived as creating a conflict of interest with my role. I will notify W3C of any change in my affiliation using W3C-provided mechanisms.\n11. 11\\. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimers. I represent and warrant that 1) I am legally entitled to grant the rights and promises set forth in this CLA and 2) I will not intentionally include any third party materials in any Contribution unless those materials are available under terms that do not conflict with this CLA and I identify any such third party materials. IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS MY CONTRIBUTIONS ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS.\" The entire risk as to implementing or otherwise using the Contribution or the Specification is assumed by the implementer and user. Except as stated herein, I expressly disclaim any warranties (express, implied, or otherwise), including implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement, fitness for a particular purpose, or title, related to the Contribution or the Specification. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY FORM OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THIS CLA, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.\n12. 12\\. Definitions.\n    1.  12.1. CLA. \"CLA\" means this Contributor Licensing Agreement.\n    2.  12.2. Contribution. \"Contribution\" means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that I intentionally submit for inclusion in the Specification, and which Contribution is actually included in the Specification. For the purposes of this definition, the method by which I \"submit\" a Contribution means any form of electronic, oral, or written communication for the purpose of discussing and improving the Specification, but excludes any such communication that I conspicuously designate in writing as not a Contribution to one or more of the Specifications developed by the Project.\n    3.  12.3. Corresponding Working Group. \"Corresponding Working Group\" is a W3C Working Group that is chartered to develop a Recommendation that takes the Specification as an input.\n    4.  12.4. Essential Claims. \"Essential Claims\" shall mean all claims in any patent or patent application in any jurisdiction in the world that would necessarily be infringed by implementation of my Contributions in an implementation of the Specification. A claim is necessarily infringed hereunder only when it is not possible to avoid infringing it because there is no non-infringing alternative for implementing the normative portions of the Specification. Existence of a non-infringing alternative shall be judged based on the state of the art at the time my Contribution is included in the Specification. The following are expressly excluded from and shall not be deemed to constitute Essential Claims:\n        1.  12.4.1. any claims other than as set forth above even if contained in the same patent as Essential Claims; and\n        2.  12.4.2. claims which would be infringed only by:\n            -   portions of an implementation that are not specified in the normative portions of the Specification, or\n            -   enabling technologies that may be necessary to make or use any product or portion thereof that complies with the Specification and are not themselves expressly set forth in the Specification (e.g., semiconductor manufacturing technology, compiler technology, object-oriented technology, basic operating system technology, and the like); or\n            -   the implementation of technology developed elsewhere and merely incorporated by reference in the body of the Specification.\n        3.  12.4.3. design patents and design registrations.\n\n        For purposes of this definition, the normative portions of the Specification shall be deemed to include only architectural and interoperability requirements. Optional features in the RFC 2119 sense are considered normative unless they are specifically identified as informative. Implementation examples or any other material that merely illustrate the requirements of the Specification are informative, rather than normative.\n\n    5.  12.5. I, Me, or My. \"I,\" \"me,\" or \"my\" refers to the signatory.\n    6.  12.6. Project. \"Project\" means the W3C Community Group or Business Group for which I executed this CLA.\n    7.  12.7. Specification. \"Specification\" means any specification developed by the Project, as of the date my Contribution is first included in that specification. W3C shall provide the authoritative mechanisms for the identification of Specifications created by the Project.\n    8.  12.8. W3C CLA RF Licensing Requirements. Subject to Section 5, with respect to my Contributions to the Specification, \"W3C CLA RF Licensing Requirements\" license shall mean a non-assignable, non-sublicensable license to make, have made, use, sell, have sold, offer to sell, import, and distribute and dispose of implementations of my Contributions in the Specification that:\n        1.  12.8.1. shall be available to all, worldwide, whether or not they are W3C Members;\n        2.  12.8.2. shall extend to all Essential Claims owned or controlled by me;\n        3.  12.8.3. may be limited to implementations of the Specification, and to what is required by the Specification;\n        4.  12.8.4. may be conditioned on a grant of a reciprocal RF license (as defined in this policy) to all Essential Claims owned or controlled by the licensee. A reciprocal license may be required to be available to all, and a reciprocal license may itself be conditioned on a further reciprocal license from all.\n        5.  12.8.5. may not be conditioned on payment of royalties, fees or other consideration;\n        6.  12.8.6. may be suspended with respect to any licensee when licensor issued by licensee for infringement of claims essential to implement the Specification or any W3C Recommendation;\n        7.  12.8.7. may not impose any further conditions or restrictions on the use of any technology, intellectual property rights, or other restrictions on behavior of the licensee, but may include reasonable, customary terms relating to operation or maintenance of the license relationship such as the following: choice of law and dispute resolution;\n        8.  12.8.8. shall not be considered accepted by an implementer who manifests an intent not to accept the terms of the W3C CLA RF Licensing Requirements license as offered by the licensor.\n        9.  12.8.9. The RF license conforming to the requirements in this policy shall be made available by the licensor as long as the Specification is in effect. The term of such license shall be for the life of the patents in question.\n\n        I am encouraged to provide a contact from which licensing information can be obtained and other relevant licensing information. Any such information will be made publicly available.\n\n    9.  12.9. You or Your. \"You,\" \"you,\" or \"your\" means any person or entity who exercises copyright or patent rights granted under this CLA, and any person or entity that person or entity controls."

            "text": "# Contributing to the W3C Process Document\nThank-you for offering to contribute to the [W3C Process Document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/). Here we provide some details on how you can contribute. \n\nChanges to the process document tend to fall into a few classes, and how the W3C handles these varies. Simple editorial changes may require little review, but more substantial changes will require a more substantial review and discussions by the W3C community. Please read the material below, and get involved as explained. \n\nIf you have any questions, please [raise an issue](/../../issues).\n\n## Simple Editorial Changes\nFor simple editorial changes, please feel free to raise a `pull request` or [raise an issue](/../../issues) on this repository. A simple editorial change can be things like spelling and grammar mistakes, broken links, and so on.\n\nSome changes may appear simple but may actually be more complicated than they appear. Don't worry - please continue to send your `pull request` or [raise an issue](/../../issues) and we can discuss. \n\n## The W3C Process Community Group\nThe W3C runs a [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/), which is an open group created to manage discussions on developing the [W3C Process Document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/). Some suggestions for changes to the [W3C Process Document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/) will need to be made within the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/), please see information below as to whether you need to take your suggestions to the group or can just raise a `pull request` or `issue`.\n\n## Changes that Affect the Way the W3C Operates but Do Not Change the Policy\nFor changes that affect the way that the W3C operates but do not change policy please do the following:\n\n* [Raise an issue](/../../issues) on this repo\n* Make sure the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) adds the issue to its agenda. This will allow you to explain why you think this is an improvement to the operation of the W3C (it's probably not helpful to provide a Pull Request until you have consensus on the approach).\n\nThe best way to ensure your issue gets added to the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) agenda is to add yourself to the group, please visit [the group homepage](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) and select the button \"Join or Leave this Group\".\n\nAnother way to ensure the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) addressed your issue is to check back on the [issues page](/../../issues) page and ask whether it has been addressed. It is more effective to join the group, but you have this option if you need it. \n\nThe [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) will discuss your issue, and decide whether the change can be made or whether the issue needs to be brought to the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#AB) or [Advisory Committee](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#AC) for discussion; see the next section for more information on this process.\n\nIf the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/) agrees the issue does not change the policy and agrees to make the changes detailed in your issue, you may either raise a `pull request` or wait for the Editor to make the required changes. Note: raising a `pull request` **will** be faster. See more details about `pull requests` below.\n\n## Changes that Affect the Way the W3C Operates and Change the Policy\nFor changes that represent a change of policy in the W3C, the idea will need to be brought to the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/2002/ab/) or [Advisory Committee](https://www.w3.org/participate/meetings). Again, a Pull Request can wait until you have gained consensus with these two committees.\n\nYou can raise the issue with the [Process Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/w3process/), and you can suggest (or they will notice) that it needs policy discussion and refer it onwards. But you may prefer to initiate that discussion yourself.\n\nGetting something in front of both the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#AB) or [Advisory Committee](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#AC) can be tricky. If your organisation is a W3C member please let your Advisory Committee member know; they will then be able to email the Advisory Committee or bring the issue up at an Advisory Committee meeting. To reach the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/2002/ab/) you can [raise an issue](/../../issues) on this repo (at least two AB members monitor this repo) or send an email to ab@w3.org.\n\nGaining consensus from the [Advisory Board](https://www.w3.org/2002/ab/) or [Advisory Committee](https://www.w3.org/participate/meetings) will take some time. After consensus has been reached you may either raise a `pull request` which include the changes agreed by these committees or wait for the Editor to make the required changes. See more details about `pull requests` below.\n\n## Edit and Pull Request Instructions\nThis is a very simple repository. To make an edit to the document simply edit the [index.html](index.html) file and send a pull request when your changes are done. If you have the rights to edit this repo your edits will need to be made on a new branch. If you do not have the rights to edit this repo please `fork` the repo, make your edits, then send a `pull request`.\n\nPull Requests should result in a correct-looking document (formats and lays out correctly).\n\n## Notes\nPlease feel free to suggest how this document can improve by [raising an issue](/../../issues) on this repo.\n"

Please ensure\nthe full problem space of the issue is explored in the discussion, and that\nconsensus has been reached by the participants, before drafting a pull request.\n\n## Normative and/or substantive contributions\n\nThe CSS Working Group operates via the consensus of its membership, and discusses \nall significant matters prior to implementation.\n\nThe Editors responsible for a particular spec are responsible for triaging their\nissues on a regular basis; however note that sometimes this can take awhile\n(anywhere from a few days to a few years) depending on the complexity of the\nissue and the work schedules of people involved--this does not mean we are\nignoring the issue.\n\nFor an issue that requires WG discussion or approval, WG members can tag/label\nit 'Agenda+' to bring it to the Working Group's attention. Unfortunately,\nGitHub doesn't allow labelling permissions without repository write permissions,\nso if you believe an issue is urgent or discussion has stalled for awhile and\nthe WG's attention is needed to move forward, ask one of the editors to flag it.\n\nThe Working Group, aside from managing issues on GitHub, mainly discusses\nspecifications and requests on [the www-style public mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/),\nand in CSSWG meetings, whose minutes are posted to www-style.\n\n### After discussion\n\nOnce the Working Group has come to a consensus, the editor may draft up and\ncommit the relevant changes for review by other contributors or a contributor\nmay file a pull request against the issue for review by the editor(s). Since\nspecification wording is tricky, it is strongly recommended that the editors\nof that particular spec be involved, either as originator or as reviewer, in\nany changes. We also encourage other participants in the issue discussion to\nreview the changes and request corrections or improvements as necessary.\n\nPlease follow the [Pull Request template](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) \nwhen contributing to the repository.\n\n### Tests\n\nFor normative changes for any specification in\n[CR or later](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work) as well as the pre-CR specifications listed\nbelow, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) PR must be\nprovided, except if testing is not practical; for other specifications it is usually appreciated.\n\nTypically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the\nspec should not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please\nexplain why and if appropriate [file an issue](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/new)\nto follow up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.\n\nThe pre-CR specifications with this testing requirement are currently:\n\n  * cssom\n  * cssom-view\n\n## Non-substantive contributions\n\nFor simple spelling, grammar, or markup fixes unrelated to the substance of a\nspecification, issuing a pull request without a corresponding issue is acceptable.\n\n## Further information\n\nSpecification source files are in [Bikeshed format](https://tabatkins.github.io/bikeshed/).\nThe CSSWG wiki has more information on other [CSSWG tooling](https://wiki.csswg.org/tools).\n\nSee [about:csswg](http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/weblog/2011/inside-csswg/)\nfor more information on how the CSSWG operates, delegates authority, and\nmakes decisions. Someday maybe we'll also have a useful official website.\n"

It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n## Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n"

This work feeds into the [language matrix](https://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) which gives an overview of languages needing attention.  The focus is especially on typographic features for which information in English is typically hard to find, such as justification, letter-spacing, vertical text, text decoration, page layout, emphasis, etc. We want to ensure that we have captured local user needs in CSS, HTML, Timed Text, Web Payments, Web Publishing, and the many other specifications that the W3C produces.\n\n讨论的议题写在[差距分析模板（英文）](https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/templates/gap-analysis/gap-analysis_template.html)中。这项工作源自列出了需要关注文种概要的[文种矩阵](https://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html) 。特别关注于一些用英文撰写的、其他地方难以找到的字体排印特性，比如分词连写、字距、竖排、文本装饰、排版、强调方式等等。我们希望保证我们要能覆盖用户在 CSS、HTML、时间轴文本、网页支付、网页出版等的需要，以及其他 W3C 出台的规范。\n\n### Documents 文档\n\n- [Chinese Layout Gap Analysis](https://w3c.github.io/clreq/gap-analysis/)\n- [Requirements for Chinese Text Layout | 中文排版需求 (ED)](https://w3c.github.io/clreq/) ([WD](https://www.w3.org/TR/clreq/))\n\n### Following 跟踪\n\nRather than just 'Watch' this repository, it is best to subscribe to the [public-i18n-cjk](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-i18n-cjk/) mailing list. That list is notified once a day (in digest form) about not only changes to this repository, but also about other W3C Working Group issues related to the Chinese writing systems. (Please use github issues rather than the mailing list to send feedback. The main purpose of the public-i18n-cjk mailing list is for notifications; meeting minutes are also sent to public-i18n-cjk.)\n\nYou can find a list of open issues, including those from W3C Working Groups, on the [Layout Tracker](https://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=clreq) page. (That link applies a `clreq` filter.)\n\n### Contributing 贡献\n\nAll contributors should read and agree with [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/w3c/clreq/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nPlease use the [GitHub issue list](https://github.com/w3c/clreq/issues) to report issues for language support, for discussions, and to send feedback about documents.  (Learn [how GitHub issues work](http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/guidelines/issues.html).)\n\n**You may raise issues in Chinese, however any substantive discussions should be summarised in English at some point, so that non-Chinese speakers can follow the rationale and contribute comments.**\n\nGroup _members_ are expert contributors who participate actively in producing the work of the group, regularly contributing text and advice to create the outputs, and participating in meetings. For more information about becoming a task force member contact [Richard Ishida](mailto:ishida@w3.org).

Key files include:\n\n* guidelines/index.html - the main guidelines file\n* guidelines/sc/<version>/*.html - files for each success criterion\n* guidelines/terms/<version>/*.html - files for each definition\n* understanding/<version>/*.html - understanding files for each success criterion\n\nWhere <version> is \"20\", content came from WCAG 2.0. \"21\" is used for content introduced in WCAG 2.1, \"22\" for WCAG 2.2, etc.\n\n## Editing Draft Success Criteria\n\n[Success Criteria Managers](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/SC_Managers_Phase1) will prepare candidate success criteria, ready for inclusion in the guidelines document. To prepare success criteria, follow these steps:\n\n1. [Clone the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/), using the URI https://github.com/w3c/wcag.git to clone.\n1. Switch to the working branch for the proposal, which is named for the shortname of the draft success criterion and the issue number, concatenated together.\n1. Find the appropriate file for the success criterion in the guidelines/sc/21 folder, named the same as the start of the branch name, and open in an HTML-capable editor. Do the same with any definitions referenced by the success criterion, in the guidelines/terms/21 folder.\n1. Open the guidelines/index.html file and remove comment marks around the lines that reference the success criterion and terms you have edited..\n1. Follow the [success criteria format](#user-content-success-criteria-format) below to create the SC content.\n1. Save the file and commit the change. NOTE: It is important to also add a suitable 'commit message'. In the comments, reference the issue number from which the proposal was developed starting with a hash, e.g., `#1`. \n1. When the success criterion is ready for Working Group review, inform the chairs. Once the proposal has been accepted by the Working Group, the editors will merge the working branch into the master branch, which puts it in the editors' draft and eventual Technical Report publication.\n\n### Success Criteria Format\n\nSuccess criteria use a simple structure of HTML elements, with a few class attribute values, to ensure consistency. Enhancement scripts and style key off this structure. Content you provide is indicated in braces. Items after comments are optional.\n\n```html\n<section class=\"sc\">\n\t<h4>{SC Handle}</h4>\n\t<p class=\"conformance-level\">{Level}</p>\n\t<p class=\"change\">{Change}</p>\n\t<p>{Main SC Text}</p>\n\t<!-- if SC has sub-points -->\n\t<dl>\n\t\t<dt>{Point Handle}</dt>\n\t\t<dd>{Point Text}</dd>\n\t</dl>\n\t<!-- if SC has notes -->\n\t<p class=\"note\">{Note}</p>\n</section>\n```\n\nNote you do not provide the SC number. Numbers will be assigned, and most likely automatically generated, later.\n\nValues you provide are described below. Refer to [Success Criterion 2.2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#time-limits-required-behaviors) for an example of each of these pieces of content.\n\n<dl>\n\t<dt>{SC Handle}</dt>\n\t<dd>The short name of the SC. In SC 2.2.1 this is \"Timing Adjustable\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Level}</dt>\n\t<dd>The conformance level of the SC. Values can be \"A\", \"AA\", or \"AAA\". Do not include the word \"Level\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Change}</dt>\n\t<dd>Indicate whether the SC is unchanged from WCAG 2.0, changed, or new. Values can be \"Unchanged\", \"Changed\", or \"New\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Main SC Text}</dt>\n\t<dd>The main text of the SC, or the starting paragraph. In SC 2.2.1 this is the content that begins \"For each time limit...\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Point Handle}</dt>\n\t<dd>If the SC has bullets, each bullet has a handle. In SC 2.2.1 the first bullet point handle is \"Turn off\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Point Text}</dt>\n\t<dd>The content of the bullet. In SC 2.2.1 the first bullet point text begins \"The user is allowed...\".</dd>\n\t<dt>{Note}</dt>\n\t<dd>If there is a note to the SC, provide it after the other content (without the starter \"Note\"). In SC 2.2.1, this is the content that begins \"This success criterion...\". If there is more than one note, multiple `<p class=\"note\">`elements may be provided.</dd>\n</dl>\n\n### Definitions\n\nIf you providing term definitions along with your SC, include them in the glossary. Position them in the appropriate alphabetical order with the rest of the terms and use the following format:\n\n```html\n<dt><dfn>{Term}</dfn></dt>\n<dd>{Definition}</dd>\n```\n\nThe ```dfn``` element tells the script that this is a term and causes special styling and linking features. To link to a term, use an `<a>` element without an `href` attribute; if the link text is the same as the term, the link will be correctly generated. For example, if there is a term `<dfn>web page</dfn>` on the page, a link in the form of `<a>web page</a>` will result in a proper link. If the link text has a different form from the canonical term, e.g., \"web pages\" (note the plural), you can provide a hint on the term definition with the `data-lt` attribute. In this example, modify the term to be `<dfn data-lt=\"web pages\">web page</dfn>`. Multiple alternate names for the term can be separated with pipe characters, with no leading or trailing space, e.g., `<dfn data-lt=\"web pages|page|pages\">web page</dfn>`.\n\n## Editing Draft Understanding Content\n\nThere is one Understanding file per success criterion, plus an index:\n\n* understanding/index.html - index page, need to uncomment or add a reference to individual Understanding pages as they are made available\n* understanding/<version>/*.html - files for each understanding page, named the same as the success criterion file in the guidelines\n\nFiles are populated with a template that provides the expected structure. Leave the template structure in place, and add content as appropriate within the sections. Elements with class=\"instructions\" provide guidance about what content to include in that section; you can remove those elements if you want but don't have to. The template for examples proposes either a bullet list or a series of sub-sections, choose one of those approaches and remove the other from the template. The template for techniques includes sub-sections for \"situations\", remove that wrapper section if not needed.\n\nUnderstanding files are referenced from the relevant Success Criterion on the WCAG specification; these links are put in by the script.\n\nThe formal publication location for Understanding pages is currently https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/. This content is updated as needed; and may be automated.\n\n## Editing Techniques\n\nTechniques are in the techniques folder, and grouped by technology into sub-folders. Each technique is a standalone file, which is in HTML format with a regular structure of elements, classes, and ids.\n\n### Technique File Structure\n\nThe [technique template](techniques/technique-template.html) shows the structure of techniques. Main sections are in top-level &lt;section> elements with specific IDs: meta, applicability, description, examples, tests, related, resources. The description and tests sections are required; the applicability and examples sections are recommended; the related and resources sections are optional. The meta section provides context for the technique during authoring but is removed for publication. The title of the technique is in the `<h1>` element. Elements with `class=\"instructions\"` provide information about populating the template. They should be removed as the technique is developed but if not removed, will be ignored by the generator. **Do not copy `class=\"instructions\"` on real content.**\n\nTechniques can use a temporary style sheet to facilitate review of drafts. This style sheet is replaced by other style sheets and structure for formal publication. To use this style sheet, add `<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"../../css/editors.css\"/>` to the head of the technique.\n\nThe generator used to publish techniques uses XML processing, so techniques must be well-formed XML. Techniques use HTML 5 structure so are actually [HTML Polyglot](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-polyglot/).  \n\n### Images, Examples, Cross References for Techniques\n\nTechniques can include images. Place the image file in the `img` folder of the relevant technology - meaning all techniques for a technology share a common set of images. Use a relative link to load the image. Most images should be loaded with a `<figure>` element and labeled with a `<figcaption>` positioned at the bottom of the figure. Small inline images may be loaded with a `<img>` element with suitable `alt` text.\n\nTechniques should include brief code examples to demonstrate how to author content that follows the technique. Code examples should be easy to read, and usually not complete content in themselves. More complete examples can be provided as [working examples](#user-content-provide-working-examples-of-techniques) (see below). Link to working examples at the bottom of each example, in a `<p class=\"working-example\">` element, containing a relative link to `../../working-examples/{example-name}/`.\n\nCross references to other techniques may be provided where useful. Generally they should be provided in the \"Related Techniques\" section but can be provided elsewhere. Use a relative link to reference the technique, `{Technique ID}` if the same technology, or `../{Technology}/{Technique ID}` otherwise. If the technique is still under development and does not have a formal ID, reference the path to the development file. If the technique is under development in a different branch, use an absolute URI to the rawgit version of the technique.\n\nCross references to guidelines and success criteria should use a relative URI to the *Understanding* page for that item. Cross references to other parts of the guidelines should use an absolute URI to the guidelines as published on the W3C TR page, a URI beginning with `https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#`. Note that references to guidelines or success criteria to which techniques relate are added by the generator upon publication based on information in the Understanding documents, so redundant links to those is not normally needed or advised.\n\n### Create Techniques\n\n[General priorities and process to work on techniques are maintained in the wiki](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Wcag21-techniques).\n\nNew techniques should use a filename that is derived from a shortened version of the technique title. Editors will assign the technique an ID and rename the file when it is accepted by the Working Group. For example, a technique \"Using the alt attribute on the img element to provide short text alternatives\" might use \"img-alt-short-text-alternatives.html\" as the filename. The editors will assign it a formal ID, and rename the file, when it is accepted by the Working Group.\n\nEach new technique should be created in a new branch. Set-up of the branch and file is automated via the create-techniques.sh script, which can be run with bash. The command line is:\n\n```Shell\nbash create-techniques.sh <technology> <filename> <type> \"<title>\"\n```\n\\<technology> is the technology directory for the technique\n\\<filename> is the temporary filename (without extension) for the technique\n\\<type> is \"technique\" or \"failure\"\n\\<title> is the title of the technique, enclosed in quotes and escaping special characters with \\\\\n\nThis automates the following steps:\n\n* Determine a filename for the technique that is likely to be descriptive, unique, and short.\n* Create a working branch named the same as the technique filename.\n* Copy the techniques/technique-template.html file into the appropriate technology folder for the technique, and give it the chosen file name.\n* In the section element with id \"meta\", indicate to which guideline or success criterion the technique relates, and whether the technique is sufficient, advisory, or a failure for that item. Multiple applicability are allowed.\n\nOnce a technique branch and file is set up, populate the content and request review:\n\n* Populate the template with appropriate content, using other techniques as examples for code formatting choices. Keep the existing structural sections from the template in place.\n* When the technique is ready for review, make a pull request into master.\n* If you wish to reference the draft technique from an Understanding document, use the technique's rawgit URI.\n* After a technique is approved, the chairs will assign it an ID and update links to it in the Undestanding documents. \n\n### Formatting Techniques\n\nTechniques in the repository are plain HTML files with minimal formatting. For publication to the editors' draft and W3C location, techniques are formatted by an XSLT-based generator managed by Apache Ant running in Java. Most people do not need to worry about this, but relevant files are the [Ant build file](build.xml) and [XSLT files](xslt).\n\nThe generator compiles the techniques together as a suite with formatting and navigation. It enforces certain structures, such as ordering top-level sections described above and standardizing headings. It attempts to process cross reference links to make sure the URIs work upon publication. One of the most substantial roles is to populate the Applicability section with references to the guidelines or success criteria to which the technique relates. The information for this comes from the Understanding documents. Proper use of the technique template is important to enable this functionality, and mal-formed techniques may cause the generator to fail.\n\n## Working Examples\n\nExamples in techniques should be brief easy-to-consume code samples of how the technique is used in content. Therefore examples should focus on the specific features the technique describes, and not include related content such as style, script, surrounding web content, etc.\n\nOften it is desirable to provide more comprehensive examples, which show the technique in action while not interfering with the main technique document. These examples also show the complete code required to make the technique operate, including full style and script files, images, page code, etc. Usually, these \"working examples\" are referenced at the bottom of the elided example which is included in the main technique.\n\nWorking examples are stored in the `working-examples` directory of the repository. Each example is in its own subdirectory, to contain the multiple files that may be necessary to make the example work. In some cases, multiple working examples will share common resources; these are stored in the appropriate sub-directory of the working-examples directory, e.g., `working-examples/css`, `working-examples/img`, `working-examples/script`. Reference these common resources when available; otherwise place resources in the working example directory, using subdirectories to organize when appropriate.\n\nTo create a working example:\n\n* Identify the name for the example, e.g., \"Using the alt attribute\".\n* Create a working branch for the example, whose name begins with the prefix `example-` and which otherwise semantically identifies the example, e.g., `example-alt-attribute`.\n* Create a directory for the example inside the working examples directory, using the semantic name for the example minus the prefix used in the branch name, e.g., `working-examples/alt-attribute/`.\n* If the primary example is HTML, name the file `index.html`. Otherwise, create a suitable file name.\n* Refer to resources shared among multiple examples using relative links, e.g., `../css/example.css`. Place other resources in the same directory as the main example, e.g., `working-examples/alt-attribute/css/alt.css`.\n* Reference working examples from techniques using the rawgit URI to the example in its development branch, e.g., `https://rawgit.com/w3c/wcag/master/working-examples/alt-attribute/`. Editors will update links when examples are approved.\n* When the example is complete and functional, submit a pull request into the master branch.\n"

This content is updated as needed; and may be automated.\n\n## Editing Techniques\n\nTechniques are in the techniques folder, and grouped by technology into sub-folders. Each technique is a standalone file, which is in HTML format with a regular structure of elements, classes, and ids. Techniques previously published for WCAG 2.0 are currently have the assigned ID of the technique as the filename, but new techniques should use a filename that is derived from a shortened version of the technique title. \n\nFor example, a technique \"Using the alt attribute on the img element to provide short text alternatives\" might use \"img-alt-short-text-alternatives.html\" as the filename.\n\n### Create Techniques\n\n* Determine a filename for the technique that is likely to be descriptive, unique, and short.\n* Create a working branch named the same as the technique filename.\n* Copy the techniques/technique-template.html file into the appropriate technology folder for the technique, and give it the chosen file name.\n* In the section element with id \"meta\", indicate to which guideline or success criterion the technique relates, and whether the technique is sufficient, advisory, or a failure for that item. Multiple applicability are allowed.\n* Populate the template with appropriate content, using other techniques as examples for code formatting choices. Keep the existing structural sections from the template in place.\n* When the technique is ready for review, ask the chairs to arrange WG review and merge.\n* If you wish to reference the draft technique from an Understanding document, use the technique's rawgit URI.\n* After a technique is approved, the chairs will assign it an ID and update links to it in the Undestanding documents. \n\n### Provide Working Examples of Techniques\n\nExamples in techniques should be brief easy-to-consume code samples of how the technique is used in content. Therefore examples should focus on the specific features the technique describes, and not include related content such as style, script, surrounding web content, etc.\n\nOften it is desirable to provide more comprehensive examples, which show the technique in action while not interfering with the main technique document. These examples also show the complete code required to make the technique operate, including full style and script files, images, page code, etc. Usually, these \"working examples\" are referenced at the bottom of the elided example which is included in the main technique.\n\nWorking examples are stored in the `working-examples` directory of the repository. Each example is in its own subdirectory, to contain the multiple files that may be necessary to make the example work. In some cases, multiple working examples will share common resources; these are stored in the appropriate sub-directory of the working-examples directory, e.g., `working-examples/css`, `working-examples/img`, `working-examples/script`. Reference these common resources when available; otherwise place resources in the working example directory, using subdirectories to organize when appropriate.\n\nTo create a working example:\n\n* Identify the name for the example, e.g., \"Using the alt attribute\".\n* Create a working branch for the example, whose name begins with the prefix `example-` and which otherwise semantically identifies the example, e.g., `example-alt-attribute`.\n* Create a directory for the example inside the working examples directory, using the semantic name for the example minus the prefix used in the branch name, e.g., `working-examples/alt-attribute/`.\n* If the primary example is HTML, name the file `index.html`. Otherwise, create a suitable file name.\n* Refer to resources shared among multiple examples using relative links, e.g., `../css/example.css`. Place other resources in the same directory as the main example, e.g., `working-examples/alt-attribute/css/alt.css`.\n* Reference working examples from techniques using the rawgit URI to the example in its development branch, e.g., `https://rawgit.com/w3c/wcag/master/working-examples/alt-attribute/`. Editors will update links when examples are approved.\n* When the example is complete and functional, submit a pull request into the master branch.\n"

This will bring you to the Github detail page of that file where you can start editing the file using the edit button (“pen icon”) in the top right corner, if you’re logged into Github. [Here’s an example in the Images Tutorial.][exmpImg]\n\nYou can start editing right away. We use the standard Markdown syntax. If you get the following note, this is expected behavior:\n\n> You are editing a file in a project you do not have write access to. We are forking this project for you (if one does not yet exist) to write your proposed changes to. Submitting a change to this file will write it to a new branch in your fork so you can send a pull request.\n\nIt is technical for “All right, make your edits, we make sure you can send them in as a proposal!”\n\nDon’t forget to add some descriptive text at the bottom that comments your change. Try to be concise. Klick the “Propose this change” button to continue. Then you get another comment field, you can write down your motivation for the change here. Once you click “Send pull request”, the editor will be notified of your proposal and may adopt it.\n\nNote that the changes are not immediately reflected on any page. If you want to see your changes in HTML that way is more technical and is described briefly in the following part of the document. But there is a preview button in the editor that gives you a fairly good example of how the rendered HTML will look like.\n\n[LivePage]:https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/\n[GHPage]:http://w3c.github.io/wai-tutorials/\n[exmpIMG]:https://github.com/w3c/wai-tutorials/blob/master/source/images/informative.html.erb.md\n"

The Report\nTool runs entirely on the client and so it can be used offline\nand in any server configuration available to you. \n\nThe Report Tool does not save files to a server or in local \nstorage. Rather, load and save functions are available for\nstoring an evaluation to your local file system.\n\nImportant references:\n\n- <http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/>\n- <http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/>\n- <http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/>\n\nThe official released version of the Report Tool can be found at <http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/report-tool/>. An example of the latest (unapproved by EO) version is available at <http://w3c.github.io/wcag-em-report-tool/dist/>.\n\nSee [Change log](changelog.md) for details about the latest version of the WCAG-EM Report Tool.\n\n\n# Install\nBefore you can install the WCAG-EM Report Tool you will need\nto install a few components:\n- NodeJS https://nodejs.org/en/\n- Ruby   https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/\n\nIn addition to these, you will need to install grunt cli. To do\nso run the following command. This will install the grunt\ncommand line interface in a global space on your machine.\n    \n    npm install grunt-cli -g\n\nNow with all global dependencies installed, the following \ncommands will install the app and its dependencies\n\n    git clone git://github.com/w3c/wcag-em-report-tool.git\n    gem install compass\n    npm install\n    bower install\n\n\n# Usage\nYou can launch a development version by running:\n\n    grunt serve\n\nTo create a build in the /dist folder run:\n\n    grunt build\n\nThe build version can be hosted in on any server that available\non http(s). WCAG-EM Report Tool runs in your local browser, so\nit only loads static files from the server.\n\n\n# Translations\nThe WCAG-EM Report Tool aims to be available for a wide audience.\nMuch effort has been put into making translations as easy as \npossible. To learn about how to create your own translations \nread the [translation documentation](docs/translation.md)\n\n\n# Get Involved\nDid you find a bug, or are you interested in working with us to\ncreate new features for the Report Tool, then \n[get involved with the project](docs/contribute.md)!\n\n# Data Format\nData in the WCAG-EM Report Tool is saved and can again be loaded\nin a JSON format. The data format is \n[JSON Linked Data](http://json-ld.org/), and uses \n[EARL](http://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/) to store the test \nresults.\n\nCustom fields are based on WCAG-EM and are documented in \n[EARL+JSON-LD format definition](docs/EARL+JSON-LD.md)."

            "text": "# WAI Accessibility Evaluation Tools\n\n## Setup and Addition of Data\n\nData is collected in the `data` directory. There are two possibilities to use it.\n\n### (A) Local setup & GitHub Pages \n\nClone the repository to your hard disk and run\n\n~~~bash\n$ npm install\n~~~\n\nto initialize the repository and install all dependencies, like grunt. To use the data files with github pages, the files need to be compiled to one `data.js` files using the gulp script. Run\n\n~~~bash\n$ gulp watch\n~~~\n\nand add/edit the data files. The `data.json` file is automatically created.\n\n### (B) Server setup & PHP\n\nIf you want the script to pick up files on the (PHP enabled) server automatically once they are saved into the data directory, do all steps in (A) but after running `gulp watch` edit the `javascript/script.js` file. Search for `data.json` and replace it with `data.json.php`. After you save that file a new `js/master.min.js` is created that is using this path. Now you can upload the files to the server, **whenever you upload a new file to the `data` directory it will be picked up by the tool automagically**.\n\n### Appendix: Data format\n\nUsually data should be entered and edited using the submission form to ensure valid JSON. The data is collected in JSON files with each entry in the following format:\n\n~~~json\n{\n  \"title\": \"<string>\",\n  \"creator\": \"<string>\",\n  \"location\": \"<url>\",\n  \"release\": \"<date format='YYYY-MM-DD'>\",\n  \"version\": \"<string>\",\n  \"description\": \"<string>\",\n  \"language\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"guideline\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"assists\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"automated\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"repairs\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"technology\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"onlineservice\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"desktopapp\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"authoringtools\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"browsers\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"reports\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"license\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"update\": [\"<array of strings>\"],\n  \"type\": [\"<array of strings>\"]\n}\n~~~\n\n`title`, `creator`, `url`, `release`, `version` and `desc` can have only one (string) value. All other fields can either be one or multiple values. If a tool has multiple values, like different languages, enclose them with square brackets and separate them with a comma. If only one value is used, the brackets are optional. (a value of \"English\" is equivalent to [\"English\"]).\n\n Due to limitations of the tool, the values have to be the same throughout the whole data set, for example “Freeware” and “FreeWare” would be considered two different strings to filter by. This is really important for the more complex things like “WCAG 2: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2” or similar.\n \n## Listing Form Configuration\n \nThe form content can easily be edited using the `config.php` file in root. It looks like this:\n \n~~~php\n<?php\ndate_default_timezone_set('UTC'); // Sets time zone, allows us to format dates from strings.\n$demo = false; // If demo mode is true, data isn’t sent to the list.\n\n$assists = array(\n\ttitle => \"Assists evaluations by:\", // Fieldset heading\n\tdata => array( // Options, format: \"shortname_no_spaces\" => \"longname\"\n\t\t\"report\" => 'Generating reports of evaluation results', \n\t\t\"wizard\" => 'Providing step-by-step evaluation guidance',\n\t\t\"inpage\" => 'Displaying information within web pages',\n\t\t\"transformation\" => 'Modifying the presentation of web pages'\n\t),\n\tother => false, // If true, a other field is displayed\n\tvariable => 'assists', // An identifier, usually the same as the variable name\n\ttype => 'checkbox', // or 'radio'\n\texplanation => array( // If items need explanations, provide it in the format \"shortname\" => \"URI\"\n\t\t\"report\" => 'http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/selectingtools.html#reports',\n\t\t\"wizard\" => 'http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/selectingtools.html#wizards',\n\t\t\"inpage\" => 'http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/selectingtools.html#in-page',\n\t\t\"transformation\" => 'http://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/selectingtools.html#transformation'\n\t)\n);\n\n/* multiple other of those blocks for configuration */\n~~~\n\n### Adding a new block\n\n1. Enter block data as noted above.\n\n2. In `submission.php`: \n\nAround line `100`, enter a line like the following: \n\n~~~php\n$data->assists = iter($_POST['assists'], $assists);\n~~~\n \nAround line `370`, enter a line like the following:\n  \n~~~php\n<?php create_form_cb_section($assists); ?>\n~~~\n\n### Exposing as filters\n\nTo expose a new category as filters, set the repository up for local editing and run `grunt watch` as described in (A) above. Then edit the `javascript/script.js` file. Under `var settings = {` you can find a few configuration options which are taken from the `facetedsearch.js` javascript library (see [bottom of this page for an example](https://eikes.github.io/facetedsearch/)). But there have been some changes to the configuration for facets:\n\n~~~js\nfacets: {\n\t'guideline' : {\n\t\t'title': 'Guidelines', \n\t\t'promoted': [\n\t\t\t\"<strong><abbr title=\\\"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines\\\">WCAG<\\/abbr> 2.0 — <abbr title=\\\"World Wide Web Consortium\\\">W3C<\\/abbr> Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0<\\/strong>\", \n\t\t\t\"<abbr title=\\\"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines\\\">WCAG<\\/abbr> 1.0 — <abbr title=\\\"World Wide Web Consortium\\\">W3C<\\/abbr> Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0\"\n\t\t]\n\t},\n\t'language'  : {\n\t\t'title': 'Languages', \n\t\t'collapsed': true\n\t},\n\t'a11yinfo' : {\n\t\t'title': 'Accessibility Statement', \n\t\t'plain': true \n\t}\n\t[…more facets…]\n},\n~~~\n\nEvery facet has a `title`, which is mandatory. It is the `<summary>` of the `<details>` element. If the facet should be collapsed by default, set `'collapsed': true`. If there should be no `<details>` & `<summary>` around that item, set `'plain': true`.\n\n"

            "text": "# WAI Dynamic Planning\n\nThis is the repository for the WAI dynamic planning resource. Developed by the\n[Education and Outreach Working Group (EOWG)](//w3.org/WAI/EO/) with support from the [WAI-DEV project](//w3.org/WAI/DEV/), co-funded by the European Commission <abbr title=\"Information Society Technologies\">IST</abbr> Programme. \n\nYou can find the current draft state of the document on [this Github Pages site][GHPage]\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe main content pages of this resource are written in Kramdown, a version of Markdown. The [Quick Reference](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) provides details on how to write content.\n\nEditing a page on GitHub works just like a Wiki.\n\nEither browse to the page in this repository and edit the file there, or visit the page in [Github Page][GHPage] and click on \"Fork and Edit\" at the bottom of the page.\n\nYou can start editing right away. If you get the following note, this is expected behavior:\n\n> You are editing a file in a project you do not have write access to. We are forking this project for you (if one does not yet exist) to write your proposed changes to. Submitting a change to this file will write it to a new branch in your fork so you can send a pull request.\n\nIt is technical for “All right, make your edits, we make sure you can send them in as a proposal!”\n\nDon’t forget to add some descriptive text at the bottom that comments your change. Try to be concise. Click the “Propose this change” button to continue. Then you get another comment field, you can write down your motivation for the change here. Once you click “Send pull request” the editor of the notified of your proposal and may adopt it.\n\n### Helpers\n\nThe resource also provides some additional convenience helpers that are used to structure the code. These are included in the page using the following code:\n\n```\n{::nomarkdown}\n<%= activity %>\n{:/}\n```\n\nThe following elements are available:\n\n<dl>\n  <dt>expand_collapse</dt>\n    <dd>Includes the markup for the expand all/collapse all controls, and adds in the markup to support expand/collapse within activities.</dd>\n\n  <dt>activity</dt>\n    <dd>Starts an activity block within a page. To end the block use <code><%= activity :end %></code></dd>\n\n  <dt>activity_body</dt>\n    <dd>Indicates where the body of the activity begins. The body is collapsed by default and expanded when the activity head is clicked.</dd>\n\n  <dt>support</dt>\n    <dd>Starts the block for supporting material. To end the block use <code><%= support :end %></code></dd>\n\n  <dt>more_information</dt>\n    <dd>Starts the block for adding additional resources that add more information to this resource. To end the block use <code><%= more_information :end %></code></dd>\n\n  <dt>related</dt>\n    <dd>Starts the block for adding activities that are related to an activity. To end the block use <code><%= related :end %></code></dd>\n\n  <dt>w3url</dt>\n    <dd>Creates a link to a W3C page so that when this resource is hosted on GitHub Pages, the links work as expected, but when it is deployed into w3.org, the links are all relative. Use this in combination with the <code>link_to</code> helper:</dd>\n    <dd><code><%= link_to \"WAI Homepage\", (w3url '/WAI/') %></code></dd>\n</dl>\n\n## Structure\n\nThis resource is built using [Middleman](//middlemanapp.com/), a static site generation tool. To build a local version of the resource do the following:\n\n* [Install Middleman](//middlemanapp.com/basics/install/)\n* Clone a version of this repository\n* Install the repository dependencies, `bundle install` in the repository root directory\n* Run the server, `middleman server`\n\nThis resource uses GitHub Pages to display the current draft version. If you wish to update this version from your cloned repository you need to:\n\n* Build a GitHub version of the resource\n\n    `BUILD_FOR_GITHUB=1 middleman build`\n\n* Deploy the build to GitHub\n\n    `middleman deploy`\n\nThe environment variable, `BUILD_FOR_GITHUB`, is used to configure URLs. So when the resource is deployed on GitHub Pages the URLs are absolute, and when built for production deployment in w3.org they are relative.\n\n## Deploying to live\n\nThe following steps are required in order to deploy this to the live w3.org environment. In order to deploy you will need the permissions to update content on w3.org.\n\n1. Build deployable version.\n\n    `middleman build`\n\n    This builds the content into the local `build` directory. Removing the `BUILD_FOR_GITHUB` means that the URLs in the pages built will be relative rather than absolute and that the `excol.js` scripts will be handled in a different way.\n\n2. CVS update the `/WAI/impl`, `/WAI/users`, and `/WAI/Policy` directories in your local version of the repository.\n\n3. Copy the following from the `build` directory to the local CVS `impl` directory:\n\n    * index.html\n    * acknowledgements.html\n    * implement.html\n    * initiate.html\n    * plan.html\n    * sustain.html\n    * stylesheets/*\n    * javascripts/*\n\n4. If necessary, edit the Planning & Implementing overview and make changes to the `/WAI/managing.html` page.\n\n5. If necessary, edit the following pages and update the navigation to change the label and URL for this resource:\n\n    * /WAI/managing.html\n    * /WAI/Policy/harmon.html\n    * /WAI/Policy/Overview.html\n    * /WAI/impl/pol.html\n    * /WAI/impl/improving.html\n    * /WAI/users/involving.html\n    * /WAI/impl/software.html\n\n6. Commit all the changes to the w3.org CVS repository.\n\n7. Check all the pages to find the typo that you accidentally left in.\n\n[GHPage]: https://w3c.github.io/wai-dynamic-planning/"

            "text": "# wai-statements\n\nAccessibility Statement generator tool pages are a part of the WAI website and therefore makes use of the [wai-website-theme](https://github.com/w3c/wai-website-theme) as dependency. Both make use of [Jekyll static site generator](https://jekyllrb.com/) to create the pages.\n\n- Github page: https://w3c.github.io/wai-statements/planning/statements/\n\n- [Requirements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/wiki/Accessibility_Statements_Requirements)\n\n---\n\n## Installation and local development\n\n### Installation as part of the WAI website\n\nThis site is build with Jekyll, [follow Jekyll's installation guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) first.\n\nThen clone this repository:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/w3c/wai-statements.git\n```\n\nIf you have installed ruby and jekyll, cd into the project and install dependencies defined inside the `Gemfile`:\n\n```\nbundle install\n```\n\nNow you can start development with:\n\n```\nbundle exec jekyll serve\n```\n\n\n### Installation as stand-alone\n\nTo use the accessibility statement generator tool as a stand-alone to include into your own site you need to build the site once with Jekyll, see \"[Installation as part of the WAI website](#installation-as-part-of-the-wai-website)\".\n\nBuild the site:\n```\nbundle exec jekyll build\n```\n\nThe complete site is build inside the `_site` folder and the generated files you need will be:\n\n- HTML: `planning/statements/generator/index.html`\n\n    You will need all contents of `<div id=\"accstatement\">` and link to required css and javascript below. The rest is all WAI website material.\n\n- CSS: `content-images/wai-statements/generator.css`\n- JS: `content-images/wai-statements/generator.js`\n- WAI theme assets: `assets/css/style.css` and `assets/scripts/main.js`\n\n    This is required for the expanding and toggling of sections and information.\n\nFor now you need to strip and modify all files manually to make it includeable into your own project.\n\n#### TODO for stand alone version\n\n- [ ] Add standalone version page `generator/standalone.html`\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Customizing the generator tool\n\n### Add, remove and update content\n\nThe generator tool is setup in such a way that content is seperated from function. In this way, adding and removing form or preview content is easy to do. Addition is only required inside the `generator.html` file.\n\n#### Editing the statement create form\n\nThe create statement contents are wrapped inside `<section class=\"page create\">`. Just simply add or remove the html markup to edit the form.\n\nThere is one extra functionality available to dynamically add extra line to grouped form input; add-line. To use this there are several practical examples inside the form. Required for add-line to work is this basic setup:\n\n```html\n<fieldset class=\"group\">\n    <legend>An add-line input group</legend>\n\n    <!--\n        OPTIONAL: Pre defined lines\n        class line is optional and will determine the count start\n    -->\n    <div class=\"field line\">\n        <label for=\"some_addline_item_1\">Some addline item 1</label>\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"some_addline_item_1\" name=\"an_addline_grouping_name\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <!--\n        REQUIRED: A prototype declared\n        class proto required\n        [n] = placeholder for the line count\n    -->\n    <div class=\"field proto\">\n        <label for=\"some_addline_item_[n]\">Some addline item [n]</label>\n        <input type=\"text\" id=\"some_addline_item_[n]\" name=\"an_addline_grouping_name\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <!--\n        REQUIRED: An add-line button\n        To add the proto to the fieldset as line\n    -->\n    <button type=\"button\" class=\"add-line\">\n        Add another line\n    </button>\n</fieldset>\n```\n\n#### Editing the statement preview\n\nThe preview statement contents are wrapped inside `<section class=\"page preview\">`. Just simply add or remove the html markup to edit the form.\n\nSame as with [editing the statement create form](#editing-the-statement-create-form), just add or remove html markup to edit the statement preview.\n\nTo print the form data into the statement preview there is some additional functionality available:\n\n- Printing formdata with `data-print` attribute:\n\n    Example print usage:\n    ```html\n    <!--\n        Single input data\n        data-print          REQUIRED    input id to print\n        data-printdefault   OPTIONAL    defaultvalue if data is missing or empty\n        data-printfilter    OPTIONAL    Output transformation; one of [lowercase, capitalize]\n    -->\n    <span data-print=\"forminput_id\" data-printdefault=\"MY_FORM_DATA\" data-printfilter=\"lowercase, capitalize\"></span>\n\n    <!--\n        Print as url\n        The data entered will also be outputted into the href\n        and can be prefixed like “mailto:” for example.\n    -->\n    <a href=\"URL_PREFIX\" data-print=\"some_url_data\"></a>\n\n    <!--\n        Print Grouped data:\n        UL or OL\n        Grouped data is stored under the group name\n        defined as name on input elements\n        Filters added are applied for each data item inside the group\n    -->\n    <ul data-print=\"some_grouped_data\"></ul>\n    ```\n\n- Conditionally show sections with `data-if` attribute:\n\n    To make the statement preview show sections based on filled form inputs / groups, you can wrap contents with a conditional element and / or include a condition to an element like:\n\n    ```html\n    <!-- Wrapped inside condition -->\n    <div data-if=\"required_data_id\">\n        <!-- Content will be visible based on available data -->\n    </div>\n\n    <!-- Or part of section -->\n    <div>\n        <!-- Other content … -->\n        <p data-if=\"some_data\">\n            This text will be shown if some_data is present.\n        </p>\n    </div>\n\n    <!-- Depending on multiple data sources -->\n    <div data-if=\"this_data, that_data\">\n        <!-- Stays hidden until one of data sources is present -->\n    </div>\n    ```\n\n#### Exceptions\n\nCurrently custom handled statement parts are:\n\n- Conformance meaning data (Updates to hidden input #accstmnt_conformance_meaning)\n- Limitations section (Still reading directly from DOM)\n\nWhen changes are required here edits on generator.js are necessary.\n\n\n### Internationalization\n\nCurrently this application does not support easy translation. For now you need to duplicate the `generator.html` file and rename both something like `generator_en.html` and `generator_fr.html`. Then just edit the contents manually.\n\nContents for the create page (form) are wrapped in `<section class=\"page create\">`, preview inside `<section class=\"page preview\">`.\n"

            "text": "# Long Task API\n\nLong Tasks is a new real user measurement (RUM) performance API to enable applications to measure responsiveness. It enables detecting presence of “long tasks” that monopolize the UI thread for extended periods of time and block other critical tasks from being executed - e.g. reacting to user input.\n\n## Background\nAs the page is loading and while the user is interacting with the page afterwards, both the application and browser queue various events that are then executed by the browser -- e.g. the user agent schedules input events based on user’s activity, the application schedules callbacks for requestAnimationFrame and other callbacks etc. Once in the queue, these events are then dequeued one-by-one by the browser and executed — see [“the anatomy of a frame”](https://aerotwist.com/blog/the-anatomy-of-a-frame) for a high-level overview of this process in Blink.\n\nHowever, some tasks can take a long time (multiple frames), and if and when that happens, the UI thread is locked and all other tasks are blocked as well. To the user this is commonly visible as a “locked up” page where the browser is unable to respond to user input; this is a major source of bad user experience on the web today:\n\n* _Delayed [“time to Interactive”](https://github.com/tdresser/time-to-interactive)_:  while the page is loading long tasks often tie up the main thread and prevent the user from interacting with the page even though the page is visually rendered. Poorly designed third-party content is a frequent culprit.\n* _High/variable input latency_: critical user interaction events (tap, click, scroll, wheel, etc) are queued behind long tasks, which yields janky and unpredictable user experience.\n* _High/variable event handling latency_: similar to input, but for processing event callbacks (e.g. onload events, and so on), which delay application updates.\n* _Janky animations and scrolling_: some animation and scrolling interactions require coordination between compositor and main threads; if the main thread is blocked due to a long task, it can affect responsiveness of animations and scrolling.\n\nSome applications (and RUM vendors) are already attempting to identify and track cases where “long tasks” happen. For example, one known pattern is to install a ~short periodic timer and inspect the elapsed time between the successive calls: if the elapsed time is greater than the timer period, then there is high likelihood that one or more long tasks have delayed execution of the timer. This mostly works, but it has several bad performance implications: the application is polling to detect long tasks, which prevents quiescence and long idle blocks (see requestIdleCallback); it’s bad for battery life; and there is no way to know what caused the delay. (e.g. first party vs third party code)\n\n[RAIL performance model](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/profile/evaluate-performance/rail?hl=en#response-respond-in-under-100ms) suggests that applications should respond in under 100ms to user input; for touch move and scrolling in under 16ms. Our goal with this API is to surface notifications about tasks that may prevent the application from hitting these targets.\n\n## Terminology\nMajor terms:\n* **frame** or **frame context** refers to the browsing context, such as iframe (not animation frame), embed or object\n* **culprit frame** refers to the frame or container (iframe, object, embed etc) that is being implicated for the long task\n* **attribution** refers to identifying the type of work (such as script, layout etc.) that contributed significantly to the long task AND which browsing context or frame is responsible for that work.\n* **minimal frame attribution** refers to the browsing context or frame that is being implicated overall for the long task\n\n## V1 API\nLong Task API introduces a new PerformanceEntry object, which will report instances of long tasks:\n```javascript\ninterface PerformanceLongTaskTiming : PerformanceEntry {\n  [SameObject, SaveSameObject] readonly attribute FrozenArray<TaskAttributionTiming> attribution;\n};\n```\n\nAttribute definitions of PerformanceLongTaskTiming:\n* entryType: \"longtask\"\n* startTime: `DOMHighResTimeStamp` of when long task started\n* duration: elapsed time (as `DOMHighResTimeStamp`) between start and finish of task\n* name: minimal frame attribution, eg. \"same-origin\", \"cross-origin\", \"unknown\" etc. Possible values are:\n * \"self\"\n * \"same-origin-ancestor\"\n * \"same-origin-descendant\"\n * \"same-origin\"\n * \"cross-origin-ancestor\"\n * \"cross-origin-descendant\"\n * \"cross-origin-unreachable\"\n * \"multiple-contexts\"\n * \"unknown\"\n\n* attribution: `sequence` of `TaskAttributionTiming`, a new `PerformanceEntry` object to report attribution within long tasks. To see how `attribute` is populated for different values of `name` see the section below: [Pointing to the culprit](#pointing-to-the-culprit)\n\n```javascript\ninterface TaskAttributionTiming : PerformanceEntry {\n  readonly attribute DOMString containerType;\n  readonly attribute DOMString containerSrc;\n  readonly attribute DOMString containerId;\n  readonly attribute DOMString containerName;\n};\n```\n\nAttribute definitions of TaskAttributionTiming:\n* entryType: “taskattribution”\n* startTime: 0\n* duration: 0\n* name: type of attribution, eg. \"script\" or \"layout\"\n* containerType: type of container for culprit frame eg. \"iframe\" (most common), \"embed\", \"object\".\n* containerName: `DOMString`, container’s name attribute\n* containerId: `DOMString`, container’s id attribute\n* containerSrc: `DOMString`, container’s src attribute\n\n\nLong tasks events will be delivered to all observers (in frames within the page or tab) regardless of which frame was responsible for the long task. The goal is to allow all pages on the web to know if and who (first party content or third party content) is causing disruptions. \n\nThe `name` field provides minimal frame attribution so that the observing frame can respond to the issue in the proper way. In addition, the `attribution` field provides further insight into the type of work (script, layout etc) that caused the long task as well as which frame is responsible for that work. For more details on how the `attribution` is set, see the \"Pointing to the culprit\" section.\n\nThe above covers existing use cases found in the wild, enables document-level attribution, and eliminates the negative performance implications mentioned earlier. To receive these notifications, the application can subscribe to them via PerformanceObserver interface:\n\n```javascript\nvar observer = new PerformanceObserver(function(list) {\n  var perfEntries = list.getEntries();\n  for (var i = 0; i < perfEntries.length; i++) {\n     // Process long task notifications:\n     // report back for analytics and monitoring\n     // ...\n  }\n});\n\n\n// register observer for long task notifications\nobserver.observe({entryTypes: [\"longtask\"]});\n\n// Long script execution after this will result in queueing \n// and receiving “longtask” entries in the observer.\n```\n\n**Long-task threshold is 50ms.** That is, the UA should emit long-task events whenever it detects tasks whose execution time exceeds >50ms. \n\n### Demo\nFor a quick demo of a partial implementation, in the latest Chrome Canary (version 55.0.2867.0 or up) go to [chrome://flags](chrome://flags) and enable the flag: \"Experimental Web Platform features\".\nThen visit this link:\nhttps://w3c.github.io/longtasks/render-jank-demo.html\n\nFor a demo of long tasks from same-origin & cross-origin frames see the demo below. Interacting with the iframed wikipedia page will generate cross-origin long task notifications.\nhttps://w3c.github.io/longtasks/demo.html\n\n\n### Pointing to the culprit\nLong task represents the top level event loop task. Within this task, different types of work (such as script, layout, style etc) may be done, and they could be executed within different frame contexts. The type of work could also be global in nature such as a long GC that is process or frame-tree wide.\n\nThus pointing to the culprit has couple of facets:\n* Pointing to the overall frame to blame for the long task on the whole: this is refered to as \"minimal frame attribution\" and is captured in the `name` field\n* Pointing to the type of work involved in the task, and its associated frame context: this is captured in `TaskAttributionTiming` objects in the `attribution` field of `PerformanceLongTaskTiming` \n\nTherefore, `name` and `attribution` fields on PerformanceLongTaskTiming together paint the picture for where the blame rests for a long task.\n\nThe security model of the web means that sometimes a long task will happen in an iframe that is unreachable from the observing frame. For instance, a long task might happen in a deeply nested iframe that is different from my origin. Or similarly, I might be an iframe doubly embedded in a document, and a long task will happen in the top-level browsing context. In the web security model, I can know from which direction the issue came, one of my ancestors or descendants, but to preserve the frame origin model, we must be careful about pointing to the specific container or frame.\n\nCurrently the TaskAttributionTiming entry in `attribution` is populated with \"script\" work (in the future layout, style etc will be added). The container or frame implicated in `attribution` should match up with the `name` as follows:\n\n| value of `name`         | frame implicated in `attribution`| \n| ----------------------- |:-------------------------:| \n| self                    | empty                     | \n| same-origin-ancestor    | same-origin culprit frame |\n| same-origin-descendant  | same-origin culprit frame | \n| same-origin             | same-origin culprit frame | \n| cross-origin-ancestor   | empty                     |\n| cross-origin-descendant | first cross-origin child frame between my own frame and culprit frame|\n| cross-origin-unreachable| empty                     |\n| multiple-contexts       | empty                     |\n| unknown                 | empty                     |\n\n\n## Privacy & Security\nLong Tasks API surfaces long tasks greater than a threshold (50ms) to developers via Javascript (Performance Observer API). It includes origin-safe attribution information about the source of the long task.\nThere is a 50ms threshold for long tasks. Together this provides adequate protection against security attacks against browser.\n\nHowever, privacy related attacks are possible, while the API doesn’t introduce any new privacy attacks, it could expedite existing privacy attacks. If this were to become an concern, additional mitigations can be implemented to address this such as dropping \"culprit\" after a per-target origin threshold is exceeded, or limiting to 10 origins per minute etc.\n\nDetailed Security & Privacy doc is here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1tIMI1gau_q6X5EBnjDNiFS5NWV9cpYJ5KKA7xPd3VB8/edit#\n\n## V2 API Sketch\nSee: https://docs.google.com/document/d/125d69JAC7nyx-Ob0a9Z31d1uHUGu4myYQ3os9EnGfdU/edit\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n### Why not just show sub-tasks vs. top-level tasks with attribution?\nThis API will show toplevel long tasks along with attribution for specific sub-tasks which were problematic.\nFor instance, within a 50ms toplevel task, sub-tasks such as a 20ms script execution or a 30ms style & layout update -- will be attributed.\nThis raises the question -- why show the toplevel task at all? Why not only show long sub-tasks such as script, style & layout etc that are directly actionable by the user? The top level task may contain some un-attributable segments such as browser work eg. GC or browser events etc.\n\nThe rationale here is that showing the toplevel task is good for web developers, even though they will actively consume the actionable sub-tasks such as long scripts and act on them. Over time the sub-task attribution will keep expanding, making more of the long task actionable.\nShowing the top-level task gives developers a direct indication of main thread busy-ness, and since this directly impacts the user experience, it is appropriate for them to know about it as a problem signal -- even if they cannot have complete visibility or full actionability for the entire length of the long task. \nIn many cases the developers may be able to repro in lab or locally and glean additional insights and get to the root cause. \nLong tasks provide context to long sub-tasks, for instance, a 20ms style and layout or a 25ms script execution may not be terrible by themselves, but if they happen consecutively (eg. script started from rAF) and cause a long 50ms task, then this is a problem for user responsiveness.\n\n"

            "text": "# PerformancePaintTiming\n\nWeb developers require more information on page load performance in the wild. \nNo single moment in time completely captures the \"loading experience\". To give developers insight into the loading experience, we propose a set of key progress metrics to capture the series of key moments during pageload which developers care about.\n\nFor detailed motivation, see the [Why First Paint?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wdxSXo_jctZjdPaJeTtYYFF-rLtUFxrU72_7h9qbQaM/edit) doc.\n\nFirst Paint (FP), is the first of these key moments, followed by First Contentful Paint (FCP). In the future, we may add additional metrics, such as First Meaningful Paint (FMP), and Time to Interactive (TTI).\n\n## Interface\nWe propose introducing the `PerformancePaintTiming` interface, extending the PerformanceEntry interface, to report the time to first paint and time to first contentful paint.\n\n```javascript\ninterface PerformancePaintTiming : PerformanceEntry {};\n```\n\nEntries will have a `name` of \"first-paint\" and \"first-contentful-paint\" respectively, and an `entryType` of `\"paint\"`. `startTime` is the `DOMHighResTimeStamp` indicating when the paint occurred, and the `duration` will always be 0.\n\n## Definition\n\n- `\"first-paint\"` entries contain a `DOMHighResTimeStamp` reporting the time when the browser first rendered after navigation. This excludes the default background paint, but includes non-default background paint. This is the first key moment developers care about in page load – when the browser has started to render the page.\n\n- `\"first-contentful-paint\"` contain a `DOMHighResTimestamp` reporting the time when the browser first rendered any text, image (including background images), non-white canvas or SVG. This includes text with pending webfonts. This is the first time users could start consuming page content.\n\n_WIP: [define processing algorithm and integration with HTML](https://github.com/w3c/paint-timing/issues/4)_\n\n---\n\nThe browser has performed a \"paint\" or \"render\" when it has converted the render tree to pixels on the screen. \n\nMore formally, we consider the browser to have \"rendered\" a document when it has updated \"the rendering or user interface of that Document and its browsing context to reflect the current state\". See the HTML spec's section on the event loop processing model – [section 7.12](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#event-loop-processing-model).\n\nThe rendering pipeline is very complex, and the timestamp should be the latest timestamp the browser is able to note in this pipeline (best effort). Typically the time at which the frame is submitted to the OS for display is recommended for this API.\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\n\nvar observer = new PerformanceObserver(function(list) {\n  var perfEntries = list.getEntries();\n  for (var i = 0; i < perfEntries.length; i++) {\n     // Process entries\n     // report back for analytics and monitoring\n     // ...\n  }\n});\n\n// register observer for paint timing notifications\nobserver.observe({entryTypes: [\"paint\"]});\n\n```\nThese entries will be buffered for the cases where PerformanceObserver is unable to register itself early enough on the page. \nFor this case paint entries can be accessed as follows:\n```javascript\n\nperformance.getEntriesByType('paint');\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nThese examples are hand annotated, based on the definitions given above.\n\n![Web page filmstrips with annotated first paint times.](filmstrip.png)\n\nSome rough bulk data can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i0-tOtZP21m3DjBJflUJYao9-WAKwWV2p9WFlVhVivg/edit#gid=1447332636) or [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nGauGA3EvN8NBC3ErWjLd8Bz-NzmmEa6q6UP5KhfgeA/edit#gid=0). This data was collected using a somewhat different definition than we're currently using – it includes white paints in `first-paint` and only looks at text and image paints for `first-contentful-paint`.\n\n#### Why not add this to Navigation Timing?\nThis belongs outside Navigation Timing because Navigation Timing is spec'd as queueing the entry on document load end; however, FCP (or FMP in the future) may not have triggered at that point.\n"

            "text": "# Device Memory\n\n## Motivation & Use cases\nA “one-size-fits-all” web experience does not work in a world with widely varying device capabilities. Web apps that delight users on high end devices can be unusable on low end devices, particularly in emerging markets.\nTo support a diverse web ecosystem that is inclusive of users on low end devices, apps need to be able to tailor their content to the device constraints. This allows users to consume content suited to their device, and ensures they have a good experience and fewer frustrations.\n\nDevelopers are interested in the “device class” for the following known use-cases:\n1. Serve a “lite” version of the site or specific components, for low end devices. Egs:\n- Google’s \"search lite\" is a 10KB search results page used in EM. \n- Serve a \"lite\" version of video player in Facebook\n- Serve lightweight tile images in Google Maps\n2. Normalize Metrics: analytics need to be able to normalize their metrics against the device-class. \nFor instance, a 100ms long task is a more severe issue on a Pixel vs. on a low end device.\n\nDevice memory is an interesting signal in this context. Low memory devices devices (under 512MB, 512MB-1GB) are widely used in emerging markets. Chrome telemetry indicates a large number of OOM (out-of-memory) crashes on foreground tabs on these devices. In this case, serving a lite version not only improves the user experience, it is necessary for the site to be usable at all (as opposed to crashing due to memory constraints).\n\n## Proposal\nWe propose a new HTTP Client Hints header and a web exposed API to surface device capabilities for memory (RAM). The mechanism should be extensible to other device capabilities such as CPU i.e. number of cores, clock speed etc.\nA Client Hints header will enable the server to deliver appropriate content, eg. a “lite” version of the site.\nThe JS API will be a convenience for analytics reporting and may be used to make runtime decisions eg. using more storage vs. making additional requests, requesting appropriate resources from the server etc.\n\nASIDE: the JS API for CPU Cores is already available via hardwareConcurrency API\n\n### The Header\nProposed Client Hints Header for memory: `Device-Memory`\\\n`Device-Memory : <value>`\\\nwhere `<value>` is an approximation of the amount of RAM in GiB (floating point number).\\\nThe `<value>` is calculated by using the actual device memory in MiB then rounding it to the nearest number where only the most significant bit can be set and the rest are zeros (nearest power of two). Then dividing that number by 1024.0 to get the value in GiB.\n\nAn upper bound and a lower bound should be set on the list of values. While implementations may choose different values, the recommended upper bound is 8GiB and the recommended lower bound is 0.25GiB (or 256MiB).\nThe upper and lower bounds are not explicit, as they are subject to change over time.\n\nThe following table illustrates some examples:\n\n| Actual in MiB | Rounded in MiB | Reported in GiB |\n|---------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| 500           | 512            | 0.5             |\n| 512           | 512            | 0.5             |\n| 768           | 512            | 0.5             |\n| 1000          | 1024           | 1               |\n| 1793          | 2048           | 2               |\n\nA full list of possible values is as follows:\n0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8\n\n#### Why separate header and rounding?\nHTTP caching doesn't deal well with mixed value headers, therefore separate headers are recommended. Also, rounding down to power of two enables caching and mitigates fingerprinting.\n\n#### When is the header sent?\nClient Hints cannot be used to enable providing network performance data on the first request, however this is being actively addressed with [this proposal](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/306#issuecomment-283549512).\nThe header is sent after an explicit per-origin opt-in via Client Hints mechanism. The following new hint will be added: `Accept-CH: Device-Memory`\n\nFor background, [Client Hints](http://httpwg.org/http-extensions/client-hints.html) provides a set of HTTP request header fields, known as Client Hints, to deliver content that is optimized for the device. In that sense using Client Hints is a great fit for this proposal.\nClient Hints recently addressed a [significant limitation in spec](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/306#issuecomment-283549512): opt-in can now be persisted across browser restarts using `max-age` in header.\n\n#### Usage Guidance\nServers can advertise support for Client Hints using the Accept-CH header field or an equivalent HTML meta element with http-equiv attribute\n```\n  Accept-CH = Device-Memory\n```\n\nThe Memory request header field is a number for the client’s device memory i.e. approximate amount of ram in GiB.\neg. 512 MiB will be reported as:\n```\n  Device-Memory: 0.5\n```\n\nServers can use this header to customize content for low memory device eg. serve light version of the app or a component such as a video player.\n\nNOTE: This header will not be immediately available in all browser. Do not assume presence of the header, and provide a graceful fallback for browsers that don't support the header.\n\n### The web exposed API\nWe propose adding the following API to navigator: `navigator.deviceMemory`\nwhich returns number of GiB of ram (floating point number) rounded down to the nearest power of two (same as the header).\n\n## Why not surface Device Class directly?\nWhile exposing a composite “Device Class” would be useful for developers, it has a number of challenges: it’s hard to specify in a future-proof manner as it is constantly changing, it requires significant and ongoing work (constantly update algorithm OR classify known devices), it is difficult to reach agreement amongst vendors, and come up with something that works for all web sites etc.\nWhile this is something worth considering down the road, we think we can get most of the benefit by exposing a couple of specific signals device memory and device CPU cores. In particular device memory is a reasonable proxy for device class.\n\n## Security & Privacy\nThe client hint header and API will only be available on HTTPS secure connections.\n\nSee [Security section in Client Hints](http://httpwg.org/http-extensions/client-hints.html#security-considerations).\nRequiring per-origin opt-in with Accept-CH restricts when the header is advertised.\nTo reduce fingerprinting risk, reported value is rounded to single most significant bit, as opposed to reporting the exact value. In addition, an upper and lower bound is placed on the reported values.\n\nNOTE: Device identification is already possible and rampant today, based on UA string.

Thank you.\n\n### W3C Legal\nContributions to this repository are intended to become part of Recommendation-track documents governed by the\n[W3C Patent Policy](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and\n[Document License](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents). To bring substantive contributions to specifications, you must either participate\nin the relevant W3C Working Group or make a non-member patent licensing commitment.\n\nIf you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all contributors in the \ncommit message. In the commit, please include on a new line,\n<pre>Contributors: +@githubusername1, +@githubusername2, ...</pre>\n\n### Line Wrapping\n\n#### Recommendations\nFormat new text to break each line within 80 characters. If you add a few new words to an existing paragraph, it's OK if that line exceeds 80 characters. If fixing the width means that the next line gets to wide, and so on, it's better to leave it since touching a lot of lines unrelated to the actual fix makes the PR harder to review. We will make automatic re-flows of the document every once in a while.\n\n#### Automatic Formatting\nYou can use [webrtc-respec-ci](https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-respec-ci) to automatically format your code. Note that this script formats the entire document and may change lines that are not part of your original patch. This can make your changes harder to review.\n\n1. Follow the instructions on \"Local use\" to setup the scripts.\n2. Run: ```make -f ../webrtc-respec-ci/Makefile linewrap LINEWRAPLENGTH=80```.\n\n### Pull Request Names\nChoose a name for your PR that would make sense in a change log.  \nExample: Add support for new attribute X on Y (fixes: #123).  \nAvoid: Fix for #123.\n\n### Linked Names\nMake names of interfaces, enums and other identifiers clickable like this ```<code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>```.\n\n### Refactoring: Moving Text\nIf your PR needs to both move a section of text and update it, please do these operations in two separate commits (or even PRs). That will make the review process simpler.\n\n### Run Linter on Examples\nIf you have made a lot of changes to the example code snippets it might be a good idea to run the example linter. For instructions, see https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-respec-ci/blob/master/check-examples/README.md\n"

Please follow them and we will be able to review your PR a lot faster when we don't have to point out style and other non-technical issues. Thank you.\n\n### W3C Legal\nContributions to this repository are intended to become part of Recommendation-track documents governed by the\n[W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and\n[Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents). To bring substantive contributions to specifications, you must either participate\nin the relevant W3C Working Group or make a non-member patent licensing commitment.\n\nIf you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all contributors in the \ncommit message. In the commit, please include on a new line,\n<pre>Contributors: +@githubusername1, +@githubusername2, ...</pre>\n\n### 80 Characters\nFormat new text to break each line within 80 characters. If you add a few new words to an existing paragraph, it's OK if that line exceeds 80 characters. If fixing the width means that the next line gets to wide, and so on, it's better to leave it since touching a lot of lines unrelated to the actual fix makes the PR harder to review. We will make automatic re-flows of the document every once in a while.\n\n### Pull Request Names\nChoose a name for your PR that would make sense in a change log.  \nExample: Add support for new attribute X on Y (fixes: #123).  \nAvoid: Fix for #123.\n\n### Linked Names\nMake names of interfaces, enums and other identifiers clickable like this ```<code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>```.\n\n### JSEP References\nReference specific sections of JSEP where possible. The syntax looks like this:  \n```<span data-jsep=\"initial-offers initial-answers\">[[!JSEP]]</span>```  \nSection aliases, to be used as data-jsep values, are found in [jsep-mapping/map.json](jsep-mapping/map.json). Information on how to update the map is found in [jsep-mapping/README.md](jsep-mapping/README.md).\n\n### Refactoring: Moving Text\nIf your PR needs to both move a section of text and update it, please do these operations in two separate commits (or even PRs). That will make the review process simpler.\n\n### Run Linter on Examples\nIf you have made a lot of changes to the example code snippets it might be a good idea to run the example linter. For instructions, see https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-respec-ci/blob/master/check-examples/README.md\n\n### Style Conventions\n\n**Strings**. Use quotes and enclose in code tags (to distinguish strings literals from quoted prose).\nExample: `<code>\"String literal\"</code>`\n\n**Booleans**. Enclose booleans in code tags (without quotes).\\\nExample: `<code>true</code>`\n\n**Enum Values**. See **Strings**.\n\n**Notes**. Use div tags for notes.\\\nExample: `<div class='note'>FYI</div>`\n\n**Internal Slots**. Use upper camel case (initial upper case letter) with a leading backslash and enclosed by two brackets. The leading backslash prevents the text in double brackets from being interpreted as a reference. If a slot name is very general, like \"Id\", it might be useful to add more information to it to avoid name collisions and make it easier to identify its owning entity. For example, \"Id\" could be extended to \"ComponentId\".\\\nExample (defining): `<dfn>[[\\FooBar]]</dfn>`\\\nExample (referencing): `<a>[[\\FooBar]]</a>`\n\n### Tests\nFor normative changes, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) PR is highly appreciated. Typically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why and if appropriate [file a web-platform-tests issue](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/new) to follow up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.\n"

If fixing the width means that the next line gets to wide, and so on, it's better to leave it since touching a lot of lines unrelated to the actual fix makes the PR harder to review. We will make automatic re-flows of the document every once in a while.\n\n### Pull Request Names\nChoose a name for your PR that would make sense in a change log.  \nExample: Add support for new attribute X on Y (fixes: #123).  \nAvoid: Fix for #123.\n\n### Linked Names\nMake names of interfaces, enums and other identifiers clickable like this ```<code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>```.\n\n### JSEP References\nReference specific sections of JSEP where possible. The syntax looks like this:  \n```<span data-jsep=\"initial-offers initial-answers\">[[!JSEP]]</span>```  \nSection aliases, to be used as data-jsep values, are found in [jsep-mapping/map.json](jsep-mapping/map.json). Information on how to update the map is found in [jsep-mapping/README.md](jsep-mapping/README.md).\n\n### Refactoring: Moving Text\nIf your PR needs to both move a section of text and update it, please do these operations in two separate commits (or even PRs). That will make the review process simpler.\n\n### Run Linter on Examples\nIf you have made a lot of changes to the example code snippets it might be a good idea to run the example linter. For instructions, see https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-respec-ci/blob/master/check-examples/README.md\n\n### Style Conventions\n\n**Strings**. Use quotes and enclose in code tags (to distinguish strings literals from quoted prose).\nExample: `<code>\"String literal\"</code>`\n\n**Booleans**. Enclose booleans in code tags (without quotes).\\\nExample: `<code>true</code>`\n\n**Enum Values**. See **Strings**.\n\n**Notes**. Use div tags for notes.\\\nExample: `<div class='note'>FYI</div>`\n\n**Internal Slots**. Use upper camel case (initial upper case letter) with a leading backslash and enclosed by two brackets. The leading backslash prevents the text in double brackets from being interpreted as a reference. If a slot name is very general, like \"Id\", it might be useful to add more information to it to avoid name collisions and make it easier to identify its owning entity. For example, \"Id\" could be extended to \"ComponentId\".\\\nExample (defining): `<dfn>[[\\FooBar]]</dfn>`\\\nExample (referencing): `<a>[[\\FooBar]]</a>`\n\n### Tests\nFor normative changes, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) PR is highly appreciated. Typically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why and if appropriate [file a web-platform-tests issue](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/new) to follow up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.\n"

            "text": "# Explainer: Clearing Site Data\n\n## The Problem\n\nDevelopers wish to have control over the data associated with their origins which users' browsers\nstore locally on their behalf. In particular, developers wish to take reasonable steps to protect\nusers from local attackers by ensuring that certain kinds of data are removed from a user's local\nmachine when it is no longer necessary (for example, upon signing out of an application, or upon\naccount deletion).\n\nDevelopers have direct access to a number of storage mechanisms, which makes it possible to perform\nthis kind of cleanup from JavaScript. `window.localStorage`, for example, is easily dealt with a\nsimple call to `window.localStorage.clear()`. Other storage mechanisms are trickier. Cookies, for\ninstance, exist cross-origin, might not be accessible to JavaScript, and could have path\nrestrictions that can make them quite difficult to enumerate. The browser's various caches are even\nmore difficult to poke at, as they're intentionally opaque.\n\nIt would be nice if browsers offered developers a mechanism that would give them power to remove the\ndata their applications are responsible for maintaining. Ideally, developers should be able to\nreliably ensure the following:\n\n1.  Data stored in an origin's client-side storage mechanisms like IndexedDB, WebSQL, Filesystem,\n    `self.localStorage`, `self.sessionStorage`, `self.caches`, etc. is cleared.\n2.  Cookies for an origin's host are removed.\n3.  Web Workers (dedicated and shared) running for an origin are terminated.\n4.  Service Workers registered for an origin are terminated and deregistered.\n5.  Resources from an origin are removed from the user agent's local cache.\n6.  None of the above can be bypassed by a maliciously active document that\n    retains interesting data in memory, and rewrites it if it's cleared.\n\n## The Proposal\n\nOne way to give developers the capabilities alluded to above would be to accept a server-sent\nassertion that an origin's data be cleared. This could be an HTTP response header whose value\nspecified a subset of locally stored data to be cleared:\nof:\n\n```\nClear-Site-Data: \"*\"\n```\n\nWith this kind of assertion, developers could handle a number of use cases:\n\n1.  When a user deletes their account from a given social media application, the \"Oh noes, you're\n    gone!\" page could be served along with `Clear-Site-Data: \"*\"` to clear out any and all sensitive\n    information that may have been persisted to the user's disk.\n\n2.  If a user signs out of a given application, it might do a more targeted cleanup, removing, for\n    example, photos from the disk cache, while retaining cookies with interesting user preferences\n    by serving `Clear-Site-Data: \"cache\"`.\n\n3.  In the case of catastrophic failure (perhaps an applications developers learn that their servers\n    were compromised for some period of time), developers can reduce the risk of a persistent\n    client-side XSS by clearing out local sources of data: `Clear-Site-Data: \"*\"`.\n"

Outstanding test work is tracked via issues in this repository and issues generally remain open until both spec and test changes land.\n\n# Test results\n- Tests can be run manually [here](http://w3c-test.org/pointerevents/)\n- The latest generated test results (currently quite old) is [here](https://w3c.github.io/test-results/pointerevents/all.html).\n- TODO: we want a live link to current test results!  This is currently hard :-(\n\n# Implementation status:\n- EdgeHTML: [Shipped](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/pointerevents)\n- Blink: [Shipped](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/4504699138998272)\n- Suggested polyfill: [jQuery PEP](https://github.com/jquery/PEP)\n- Gecko: [In development](https://platform-status.mozilla.org/#pointer-events) (though enabled on desktop in Firefox 59)\n- WebKit: [Opposition](https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/2012-December/023050.html)\n"

Let's make the Web rock our socks\noff!\n\nMedia Source Extensions:\n http://w3c.github.io/media-source/\n\n\nMedia Source Extensions Byte Stream Format Registry:\n http://w3c.github.io/media-source/byte-stream-format-registry.html\n\nWebM Byte Stream Format\n http://w3c.github.io/media-source/webm-byte-stream-format.html\n\nISO BMFF Byte Stream Format:\n http://w3c.github.io/media-source/isobmff-byte-stream-format.html\n\nMPEG-2 Transport Streams Byte Stream Format:\nhttp://w3c.github.io/media-source/mp2t-byte-stream-format.html\n\nMPEG Audio Byte Stream Format:\n http://w3c.github.io/media-source/mpeg-audio-byte-stream-format.html\n\n# Issue labeling and milestone guidance\n\n## Labels\nEach bug may have multiple labels.\n\n### “needs feedback”:\nThe issue is pending further clarification from the assignee, likely the original bug filer or another who reported aspects of the issue in the bug’s history. The feedback request needs to be in a comment associated with the addition of this label, along with a request for reassignment back to an editor once feedback is provided.\n\n### “needs author input”:\nThe editors are seeking input from web authors on the issue. For example, whether a requested change is useful or how best to expose information.\n\n### “needs follow-up”:\nThe assignee, likely an editor, needs to investigate more deeply before we can decide if this “needs implementation” or to otherwise move forward. The editors have discussed the issue and do not need to discuss it further until we have the resulting follow-up from the assignee. This includes things like determining external spec dependencies, seeking input from other spec owners and/or WGs, confirming the understanding of the nature of the bug, and beginning to formulate a path to a solution.\n\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean follow-up has “Started” or is “In Progress.”\n\n### “needs implementation”:\nThe steps needed to resolve this issue are clearly understood and agreed upon. This likely means drafting and committing a spec change, possibly via a pull request. No further discussion is necessary at this time, though review of the change may still be appropriate. Should that change, this label should be removed.\n\nFor a bug to be labeled with this, it needs to be understood well enough and in scope of the marked milestone. Otherwise, “needs follow-up” or punting milestone might be options.\n\nThis label does not refer to user agent implementations.\n\n### “blocked”:\nSome external dependency or another GitHub issue identified in comment associated with this label’s addition is (or might be) blocking progress on this bug.\n\n### “feature request”:\nThe issue is related to or requesting a new use case or capability not currently (explicitly) covered by the spec. Depending on the nature and impact of the request and the stage of the spec, it may be assigned to a future milestone.\n\n### “interoperability”:\nResolution of this issue is particularly important for interoperability among user agents. This may include breaking API changes, issues related to media compatibility across user agents, or ambiguous parts of the spec that could lead to different incompatible interpretations. There may be known or probable differing interpretations in implementations of the associated portion of the spec. If the identified issue is not addressed, there is a high likelihood of meaningful interoperability problems. The fix for the issue would need to provide a clear direction to prevent differing interpretations by user agents.\n\n### \"breaking change\"\nThe issue's resolution might cause re-entry to the current spec phase, for example CR.\n\n### “wontfix”, “invalid”, “duplicate”:\nSelf-explanatory :)\n\nIssues with these labels should always be closed (unless they were re-opened at which time an editor should probably remove these labels if the re-opening is accepted).\n\n\n## Milestones\nFor greater detail, see our V1 triage process announcement in [the archive](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-media/2016Mar/0003.html).\n\n### “V#”:\nA bug in version # of the spec.\nCurrently, V1 is the first version of MSE (in CR in Q4 2015).\n\n### \"V#NonBlocking\"\nA bug in version # of the spec, which is an editorial change to improve spec language. These should not be treated as blocking on the WG timeline, so the clock may run out before all are fixed.\n\n### “VNext”:\nPerhaps to be addressed by some later version of the spec; not currently expected to be in scope of specific version of the spec. Typically, this milestone is correlated with issues labeled “feature request”. This is equivalent to Bugzilla’s RESOLVED LATER status. As such and to keep the issue tracker focused, issues with this milestone will generally be closed. When work on a new version of the spec starts, the V.Next issues, including those that are closed, should be reviewed and considered for the new version.\n\n### (no milestone):\nThe issue has not been triaged or the editors are currently discussing.\n"

See [Issue #661](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/661) for the progress of upstreaming those parts from the partially out-of-date [Shadow DOM](https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/shadow/) document.\n    - [Issues against the DOM and HTML Standard](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Awhatwg+label%3A%22topic%3A+shadow%22+is%3Aopen).\n    - [Issues raised in this repository](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/labels/shadow-dom).\n    - [The old issue tracker](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/showdependencytree.cgi?id=14978) on W3C bugzilla, which is no longer used.\n- Custom Elements\n    - Custom elements were upstreamed into the [HTML Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#custom-elements) (and bits in the DOM Standard) and are maintained there.\n    - [Issues against the DOM and HTML Standard](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Awhatwg+label%3A%22topic%3A+custom%20elements%22+is%3Aopen).\n    - [Issues raised in this repository](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/labels/custom-elements).\n    - [The old issue tracker](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/showdependencytree.cgi?id=14968) on W3C bugzilla, which is no longer used.\n- HTML Templates\n    - HTML Templates were upstreamed into the [HTML Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#the-template-element) and are fully maintained there.\n- CSS changes\n    - The CSS WG works on [CSS Scoping](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping/) and [CSS Shadow Parts](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-shadow-parts/), which help dealing with shadow trees with various selectors. Various other parts of CSS and its object model are also impacted by shadow trees and directly worked on in the various CSS specificaions.\n    - [Issues against the CSS WG repository](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/labels/topic%3A%20shadow).\n\n## Issues\n\nPlease file issues in the most specific repository possible, per the above issue pointers. (It's often not this repository.)\n\n## Abandoned features:\n\n- [HTML Imports](https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/imports/)\n    - [The current issue tracker](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/labels/html-imports).\n    - [The old issue tracker](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/showdependencytree.cgi?id=20683) on W3C bugzilla, which is no longer used.\n    - Note: Although it is still a rough idea, *HTML Modules*, rebuilding HTML Imports functionality using the ES Modules, are now being planned.\n      See [HTML Imports and ES Modules](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/HTML-Imports-and-ES-Modules.md) for details.\n"

You may also want to read [how the spec is built](https://github.com/w3c/html/blob/master/docs/build-documentation.md).\n\nEditorial improvements are welcome, just make a [Pull Request (PR)](https://github.com/w3c/html/pulls)! You may encounter a warning about Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) commitments if you are not a member of the W3C [Web Platform Working Group (WebPlat WG)](https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/), but this will be handled by the WebPlat WG editorial team. Specific concerns about IPR and the W3C may be found in the [Intellectual Rights FAQ](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620.html).\n\nYour concern might already be known. Before beginning work, check [the issue tracker](https://github.com/w3c/html/issues) to see if there are any existing discussions about the issue. If you want to help but are unsure how to begin, some issues are marked as [good first issues](https://github.com/w3c/html/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or [help wanted](https://github.com/w3c/html/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). These might be good places to start. \n\nProposals for new elements are best discussed on the [WICG Discourse](https://discourse.wicg.io/).\n\nTo make **substantive** contributions, changes that clarify or update conformance requirements, you must either participate in the W3C [Web Platform Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WebPlatform/WG/) or make a [non-member patent licensing commitment](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/83482/nmlc). \nThis is because the W3C Patent Policy depends on granting licenses for the [essential claims](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/#def-essential) needed to implement the spec. A list of [previous substantive contributions](https://github.com/w3c/html/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aclosed+label%3Asubstantive) can be found on the issue tracker.\n\nIf your contribution includes the work of others, please see [Contributing Documentation](https://github.com/w3c/html/blob/master/docs/contributing-documentation.md) for further guidance.\n\n## Tests\n\nFor **substantive changes**, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests) PR is highly appreciated. The W3C defines a normative change as edits that affect the formal part of the Recommendation, rules that everyone must follow. **Non-substantive** changes affect supplementary information and guidance for these rules.\n\nTypically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why and if appropriate [file an issue](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/new) to follow up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.\n\n## Language and Terminology\n\nIt may help to familiarize yourself with the specific language used by the W3C HTML Recommendation. A [full Index of terms](https://w3c.github.io/html/fullindex.html#index) used by the specification is available, as well as a [Manual of Style](https://w3c.github.io/manual-of-style/).\n"

            "text": "**The Input Events spec**\n\n[Level 1](https://rawgit.com/w3c/input-events/v1/index.html)\n\n[Level 2](http://w3c.github.io/input-events/)\n\nLevel 1 has two implementations (Chrome and Safari) and level 2 has one (Safari). Level 2 corresponds to the consensus reached within the Editing Taskforce at the end of 2016. Level 1 is a subset that was split off in early 2017, when the Chromium team announced that it would not implement the entire specifition. At this time Safari had already implemented the full specification. We also did not want to give up level 2 of the spec, because it actually resolves a lot of issues and there has been no counter-proposal to effectively solve these issues from the Android team or others. Given that Chromium team told the Editing Taskforce that it either had to release a spec with their proposed changes or they would drop the spec entirely, it was decided to split the specification in two levels.\n\nEven though the specs look somewhat similar, they have to be handled quite differently by JavaScript editors:\n\n* Level 1 gives the JS editor information about proposed changes from the user, but it makes the related DOM change be non-cancelable in many cases. The event is therefore only useful in combination with a way to roll back the DOM after the DOM change has been made, most likely a DOM-diffing library. In the case of IME, it is extra difficult to handle as DOM changes cannot be reverted before the composition has finished.\n\n* Level 2 gives the JS editor information information about the proposed changes from the user and let's the JS author cancel the changes the browser otherwise would have done. There is one exception to this and that is IME, which cannot be canceled due to various technical constraints, but events have been added before and after IME input that effectively allow the JS author to isolate IME input. A JS editor based on level 2 should therefore be implementable without including DOM-diffing libraries or rolling browser-made DOM-changes back. A test of trying to create an editor using the event was conducted by the CKEditor team in the second half of 2016 before it was implemented in browsers.\n"

This is developed by the [ARIA Working Group](http://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/). The staff contact is [Michael Cooper](http://www.w3.org/People/cooper/). Please do not provide commit access to this repository without coordination.\n\n## Other Repositories\n\nThis repository is for the main deliverable of the ARIA Working Group, Accessible Rich Internet Applications. There are several other deliverables, such as ARIA modules, Accessibility API Mappings, and support documents. These are maintained in separate repositories listed on the [ARIA Contribution](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/contribute) page. Please file issues in the repository specific to the specification to which the issue applies.\n\n## Contributing to this Repository\n\n### Role of Editors\n\nOnly formally designated editors have commit access to this repository. Editors are designated by the Working Group Chair and make the following commitments:\n\n* Execute the consensus of the Working Group regardless of personal opinion;\n* Seek Working Group review of substantive technical issues;\n* In good faith separate editorial issues, which may be addressed without explicit review requests, from substantive issues which require review;\n* Follow the [W3C Manual of Style](http://www.w3.org/2001/06/manual/) and the [Chicago Manual of Style](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/);\n* Follow [W3C Editors](http://www.w3.org/2003/Editors/) guidelines.\n\n### Non-Editor Contributions\n\nWorking Group participants and members of the public without commit privileges may contribute to this repository in the following ways:\n\n* Raise [issues](issues).\n* Submit [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).\n\nIssues can be assigned to people who are members of the [ARIA Contributors](https://github.com/orgs/w3c/teams/aria-contributors) team. Editors can add people to this team.\n\nWhen preparing GitHub pull requests:\n\n* Provide a complete summary and description for each pull request. The Working Group needs to understand the rationale for proposed changes. This description may need to be very detailed in some cases, or may be quite brief, for example if providing a change to address a spelling issue.\n* Keep pull requests specific to individual comments. Some comments may require changes to multiple source files, for example if an external link is incorrect in multiple files, and this is appropriate if the changes all relate to the same comment. However, if several separate comments are submitted together within a single pull request,  it is more difficult for the working group to parse the different points made in the comment and unless the group agrees with all aspects of the comment the pull request may need to be rejected.\n* Whenever possible, please create a separate pull request for each specification you are modifying. Doing so allows each specification editor to incorporate your contributions without having to check with the editors of the other documents you are modifying or to perform multiple manual merges.\n* Following the editorial documentation below will help prepare a pull request that is ready for inclusion with minimal editing.\n\nWhen a pull request is accepted by the Working Group, an editor will integrate changes. Pull requests and issues that are accepted by the working group will be merged into the source documents and the commenter will receive a notification from GitHub that the pull request was accepted.\n\n## Editorial Documentation\n\nDocuments in this repository use the [Respec](http://www.w3.org/respec/) preprocessor.\n\n### Special Elements and Classes\n\n#### Role, State, and Property References\n\nThe ARIA spec allows easy generation of links to roles, states, and properties, with the right link and styling. Simply enclose the name of the role, state, or property in the following elements:\n\n* `<rref>` for roles\n* `<sref>` for states\n* `<pref>` for properties\n\nNote: this only works in the ARIA spec. Other specs must use cross references as defined below.\n\n#### References to Other ARIA Specs\n\nLinks with special class attributes allow cross references into other specs in the suite, which are transformed by the script to be the appropriate target for the given publication, so editors' drafts point to other editors' drafts, and TR publications point to other TR publications. This requires some configuration options in the respecConfig and use of special class attributes.\n\nFirst, for each document that might be referenced, a set of URLs is provided. The URLs are indexed by values of the [respec spec status](http://www.w3.org/respec/ref.html#specstatus), which ensures the target at the same level of maturity as the current version is used. A typical set of values for the main ARIA spec is:\n\n```js\n// Spec URLs\nariaSpecURLs: {\n  \"FPWD\": \"http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/\",\n  \"ED\": \"http://w3c.github.io/aria/aria/aria.html\",\n  \"WD\" : \"http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/\",\n  \"REC\": \"http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/\"\n},\n```\n\nNote that even though some of these URIs are redundant, they must all be defined to work in all circumstances. If a document is a First Public Working Draft but the FPWD variant isn't defined, there won't be a match with the `specStatus` and the links won't work.\n\nThe following properties for cross references are currently available *(todo: we should add versions for the other docs)*:\n\n* `ariaSpecURLs`: for the main ARIA spec\n* `coreMappingURLs`: for the Core AAM\n* `accNameURLs`: for the AccName AAM\n* `htmlMappingURLs`: for the HTML AAM\n\nThe task of fixing up links is done by a script that needs to be hooked in via the following line in the respecConfig:\n\n```js\npreProcess: [ linkCrossReferences ]\n```\n\nOnce all this is defined in the `respecConfig`, use the `class` attribute on the links to activate the script for that link. The value of the `href` should be the fragment you want to target, i.e,. the hash tag and fragment ID. For example, a link to the list of roles in the ARIA spec would be:\n\n```html\n<a href=\"#role_definitions\" class=\"specref\">ARIA roles</a>\n```\n\nIf you want to target the main spec, leave the href blank (but present). If you want other classes on the link, e.g., for styling, provide them after the script-hooking class, for instance `class=\"specref role-reference\"`.\n\nThe set of class values currently defined are:\n\n* `role-reference`: role definitions\n* `state-reference`: state definitions\n* `property-reference`: property definitions\n* `specref`: other targets in the main ARIA spec\n* `core-mapping`: the Core AAM\n* `html-mapping`: the HTML AAM\n* `accname`: the AccName AAM\n\n*Todo: we should add versions for the other docs*\n\n### Shared Resources\n\nThe ARIA repositories share a common set of resources to reduce redundancy. Shared resources are in the [aria-common](https://github.com/w3c/aria-common/) repository, and copied to a \"common\" folder in this and other ARIA repositories. *It is important to make edits in the aria-common repository*; making edits in the common folder of another repository will allow the edits to be overridden.\n\n### Special Structures\n\nTodo: special characteristics table classes etc. used by the script\n\n### Editors' Drafts\n\nOfficial editors' drafts are published to  [https://w3c.github.io/aria/]. This URI is suitable for public references. Documents published to that location are *static* snapshots from the Respec processor. This is to minimize load time for consumers of these drafts. Editors' drafts are automatically updated (if there are no errors) by a [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) service run when commits are pushed to the master branch.\n\n### How ARIA Extension Specs are Built\n\nAn extension spec is one that defines additional roles, states, and / or properties that augment\nthe collection defined in the core ARIA specification (aria/aria.html).  Extension specs must be\nbuilt in conjunction with the W3C ARIA WG if any new roles are to be in the default vocabulary space\n(http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab).\n\nWhen building an extension spec, use the boiler plate provided in aria/template.html as a basis.  \n\nNote that this template uses the aria/script/ariaChild.js script.  That script knows how to incorporate\ninformation from the core ARIA specification into the extension spec so that new roles, states, and properties\nare well integrated into the overall ARIA taxonomy.\n\nThe ariaChild.js script relies upon an input script (aria/script/roleInfo.js).  As of today, that file is not automatically generated.\nIf you want to ensure the file is up to date, access the core ARIA spec with the special query string \"#saveRoles\"\nfrom a browser on a client that has write access to the copy of the extension spec you are editing. When the dialog appears, click\nthe save button and tell your browser to save the roleInfo.js file into the aria/script directory.\n\nThe scripts to support extension modules are stored in the aria-common repository. Therefore, updates to roleInfo.js must be saved and committed to that repository, even though they are generated from content in this repository.\n\n### Style guidelines\n\n#### Document style\n\n* There should always be introductory content before starting subsections.\n* Sequences of steps use ordered lists, the first paragraph of which labels the step and is in a &lt;strong&gt;; subsequent block elements are the content for the step.\n* Preformatted examples should \"pretty-print\" the example to be less than 80 characters wide, and indent the code using 2 space characters per indent step. Wrap within an element tag with an extra indent. Use line break characters, not &lt;br/&gt; elements, for new lines. Add extra line spacing as useful. They use the class \"example\". Use the Code Sample Expander tool to assist with this.\n* Keyboard characters should be in kbd elements.\n    * Spell out keys such as \"control\", \"shift\", \"command\", \"option\", \"alt\", \"insert\", \"pageup\", \"enter\", etc.\n    * Use plus as delimiter for keys that are pressed together, e.g., control+v\n    * Use comma as delimiter for keys that are pressed in sequence, e.g., insert, m\n* Language elements should be in code elements.\n* The first reference in a section to a role or state should be linked to the role or state with the appropriate class. Subsequent references needn't be referenced, but may be in certain circumstances.\n* repeated links to aria features should just be in &lt;code&gt;, not in cross-reference links (just link first time)\n* Headings use title case.\n* \"step\" headings, the bold sentence at the start of a numbered list item in a list of steps, are sentence case and not marked as an actual hx element. They should summarize what the following paragraphs get into.\n* Subheadings: only use sub-headers (&lt;h{x+1}&gt; following &lt;hx&gt;) if there are at least two of them. If there isn't more than two sub-sections, it isn't a sub-section and should be integrated into the parent section.\n* Lists: only use lists of two or more items. If it's only one item, it isn't a list and should have a different semantic.\n* Terms like \"Web\" are capitalized when it's \"the Web\", but not when referring to \"web applications\". Same for \"internet, rich internet applications\".\n* Synopsize the meaning of abbreviations and glossary terms the first time they are used in a section.\n* Acronyms we don't expand (but wrap in &lt;abbr&gt; elements):\n    * API\n* Acronyms we do expand (don't use the acronym)\n    * RIA (use rich internet application)\n    * AT (use assistive technology)\n* Cross reference links don't include section numbers.\n* Refer to states and properties in prose as \"attributes\", not as \"states\" or \"properties\" in order to be less confusing. (though they're still formally states or properties)\n\n#### Preferred terminology\n\n* When referring to an instance of a role, use \"element with a role of X\", not \"X role\" or \"X element\". \"X role\" refers to role in the taxonomy itself; \"X element\" is not technically meaningful.\n* \"Ajax\" is not spelled \"AJAX\"\n* \"Assistive technologies\" is plural, not singular.\n* Use \"WAI-ARIA\" instead of \"ARIA\", to avoid trademark confusion.\n* Use \"text alternative\" instead of \"text equivalent\" or the like, for consistency with WCAG 2.0 usage.\n* Reference \"DOMClick\" instead of \"DOMActivate\" which is going to be deprecated or made optional.\n\n#### Specification rules\n\n* Descendants of the composite role MUST NOT have the \"nameFrom\" value of \"contents\" set.\n* The composite role and its descendants MUST NOT have a childrenArePresentational value of \"true\".\n\n### Quality Assurance Checklist\n\nIn general, but particularly when preparing documents for TR publication, editors should check the following quality points:\n\n* Editor / author credits\n* [Participant credits](common/acknowledgements.html)\n* Documents are [valid HTML 5](http://validator.w3.org/)\n* Documents use the [HTML Polyglot](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-polyglot/) syntax to allow XML-based tools to process them and help catch errors caused by markup ambiguities.\n* Documents do not have [broken links or unnecessary redirects](http://validator.w3.org/checklink)\n* Spelling / typos\n* Consistent use of approved spellings when multiple are possible\n\n### Semi-Automated Sanity Checking\n\nThere was some automated sanity checking available, previously run by XSLT. This feature may be restored. The sanity check report helped determine the following potential issues:\n\n* When inheritance of roles change, the states they support may change. The tools will indicate when there is a change of supported states by comparison to an earlier version of the spec. It is a manual decision whether the changes are desired or if the set of supported states needs to be updated.\n* Ensure that supported state not defined if the state is also inherited\n* Check that the role spec and the UML Class Diagram express the same thing\n* Roles list only supported states that are defined\n* States indicate applicability only to roles that are defined\n* Roles and states cross reference each other: roles indicate supported states, and those states indicate applicability to those roles; discrepancies called out for manual attention\n"

Each milestone corresponds to a working draft or release published to w3.org.\n* Work is organized by topic in our [projects](https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/projects). Each project corresponds to a type of design pattern or section of guidance.\n* The [scope of work and roadmap](https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/wiki/Scope) are described in the project wiki.\n\n## Contributing\n\n1. Comment in an existing issue or raise a new issue, expressing your willingness to help and briefly summarizing the nature of your proposed resolution.\n2. An editor will confirm there are no conflicting plans and, if needed, provide guidance.\n3. Be sure you have ESLint configured as described below.\n4. Read our wiki page about [submitting pull requests](https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/wiki/Submitting-Pull-Requests).\n5. Do some fabulous work and submit a pull request.\n\nNote: Please feel free to ask questions either through an issue or on the [Authoring Practices Task Force mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-aria-practices/).\n\n### Code conformance\n\n* All HTML should validate in the NU HTML Validator. Exceptions to this rule are warnings and errors related to future ARIA features that are not yet implemented.\n* To keep code in this repository consistent:\n    * Read the [code guide](https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/wiki/Code-Guide)\n    * Use a text editor that supports [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/).\n    * Make sure All code tests clean with ESLint.\n\n### Running ESLint, the pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and JSX\n\n[ESLint](http://eslint.org/) is an automated code style checker. We use it to\nensure common code styling practices in this repository.\nPull requests with ESLint errors will not be merged.\n\n### Setup ESLint so you can run it locally\n\n1. If you do not already have node.js installed, go to the [node installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)\n1. When you install Node, NPM is included.\n1. In a terminal window from the directory that contains the `aria-practices`\nrepository, run `npm install`.\nA successful install will display a tree of installed packages.\n\n### Test and fix your code\n\n1. Open a terminal window to the directory that contains the `aria-practices` repository\n1. The repository has a script defined that will test all JavaScript in the examples directory. To run it, execute the command `npm test`.\n1. Many errors can be fixed automatically with the command `npm run fix`.\n1. After running fix, test again to see what you need to fix manually.\n\nWhen the linter encounters errors, it will report them in the console.\nThe error report will contain the file name and line number, and it will\nindicate the character or place in the line that raised the style violation. To\nfix an error, satisfy the change that the violation indicates.\n\nFor example, here is an error for an invalid variable name style. Variables must\nfollow a camelCase convention.\n\n```\n/Users/user1/Documents/github/aria-practices/examples/slider/js/text-slider.js\n  19:8  error  Identifier 'value_nodes' is not in camel case  camelcase\n```\n\nThe error occurred in `examples/slider/js/text-slider.js`, on line 19 and the\noffending character is indicated by the number `8` after the colon. Change the\nvariable `value_nodes` to `valueNodes` in your source file to eliminate this\nerror.\n\nTo see the complete list of style rules that are applied by ESLint, review the [.eslint.json](https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices/blob/master/.eslint.json) file in the root of the project.\n\n### Editorial documentation\n\nGeneral documentation for editing ARIA deliverables is available in the\n[ARIA repository](https://github.com/w3c/aria/).\nSome of that documentation covers technical procedures not needed\nfor this specification.\n\n## How to update document snapshot\n\nNote: These instructions are for editors of the APG who have repository commit access.\n\n1. Go to the [editors draft on rawgit](https://cdn.rawgit.com/w3c/aria-practices/master/aria-practices.html)\n2. Press the ReSpec button (top right hand corner)\n3. Select 'Save snapshot'\n4. Select 'Save as HTML'\n5. Open the gh-pages branch of the `aria-practices` repository\n6. Open `index.html` in your preferred editor\n7. Overwrite contents of `index.html` with the snapshot copy you saved\n8. Commit and push changes\n9. Review changes at [GitHub pages APG snapshot](http://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/)\n"

It contains files shared by several other ARIA repositories, and copied into those repositories. Note *content must be updated in w3c/aria-common*; changes made in copies are overwritten next time content from this repository is synced.\n\nResources in the common files:\n\n## Terms\n\nThe specifications share a common set of term definitions, located in [terms.html](terms.html). Add and update terms there, keeping in mind your edits will affect all specifications. To use the terms, at the place you want the terms to be included, provide the following line:\n\n```html\n<div data-include=\"../common/terms.html\" data-oninclude=\"restrictReferences\"></div>\n```\n\nThis includes the terms file and filters it to only output ones that are referenced in that particular specification.\n\n## Bibliography\n\nThe Respec processor loads a bibliography called [Specref](https://github.com/tobie/specref). This resource automatically includes most publications that have been published to the W3C Technical Reports page. While it is possible to request additions to this via pull requests, in practice to use references that are not in that database, it is easier to use a [`localBiblio`](https://github.com/w3c/respec/wiki/localBiblio). This allows the Respec configuration to load additional bibliographic entries, structured in the same way as in Specref.\n\nMany of the supplementary bibliographic entries needed for the ARIA publications are common to several specifications. Therefore the bibliographic entries are all stored in [biblio.js](biblio.js). This is loaded with the other scripts at the top of the file with the following line:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"../common/biblio.js\" class=\"remove\"></script>\n```\n\nIn the respecConfig, instead of providing the set of bibliographic entries directly, simply reference the object created by that script:\n\n```html\nlocalBiblio: biblio,\n```\n\n## Images, CSS, and Scripts\n\nThe `common` directory also contains shared images, CSS, and scripts. Some of the scripts extend the Respec formatting processor, and others are meant to be used with the final output version. When a resource is, or is likely to be, shared, put it in the common directory. Resources specific to a particular specification, including overriding CSS, can be placed in the directory for that specification. Use the same sub-directory structure of `img`, `css`, and `script` to help keep files organized.\n"

Also, before submitting feedback, please familiarize yourself with [our current issues list](https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/issues) and review the [mailing list discussion](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webauthn/).\n\n# Building the Draft\n\nFormatted HTML for the draft can be built using `bikeshed` (see below for instructions for `bikeshed` installation):\n\n```\n$ bikeshed spec\n```\n\nYou may also want to use the `watch` functionality to automatically regenerate as you make changes:\n\n```\n$ bikeshed watch\n```\n\n# Bikeshed Installation and Setup\n\nYou will need to have the Python tools `pygments` and `bikeshed` to build the draft. Pygments can be obtained via `pip`, but Bikeshed will need to be downloaded with `git`:\n\n```\ngit clone --depth=1 --branch=master https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed.git ./bikeshed\npip install pygments\npip install --editable ./bikeshed\ncp -R .spec-data/* ./bikeshed/bikeshed/spec-data\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the [Vagrant VM with `bikeshed` already installed](vagrant/bikeshed), or the [Docker image](docker/bikeshed).\n\n\n# Continuous Integration & Branches\n\nThis repository uses `.deploy-output.sh` to generate the Editor's Draft on the `gh-pages` branch upon every merge to `master`. In order to prevent failed merges during continuous integration, the formatted Editor's Draft should not be checked in to `master`, and it is in the `.gitignore` file.\n\n# Creating a new Working Draft\n\nTo build a new WD and upload it to the W3C publishing system:\n- Register as a W3C member and join the Web Authentication working group. Note down your W3C USERNAME and PASSWORD to use in the command below. If you don't remember either one, please go [here](https://www.w3.org/accounts/recover) to retrieve it.\n- Copy the url of the meeting minutes in which the working group decided to publish a new draft as the DECISION_URL to be used below\n- Make sure Bikeshed is installed locally (follow the Bikeshed Installation and Setup section above)\n- Go into the ./bikeshed directory and use git pull to update Bikeshed.\n- Run the following command to update Bikeshed's datafiles: \n```\nbikeshed update\n```\n- Edit the Bikeshed metadata to change the status from ED to WD (do not commit this change)\n- Ensure Bikeshed can compile without any error or warning by running through the following command: \n```\nbikeshed spec\n```\n- Build and upload the new draft with\n```\nbikeshed echidna --u USERNAME --p PASSWORD --d DECISION_URL\n```\n\nThe command above will create a tarball of the HTML and images, and upload to Echidna, W3C's automated publishing system. The command should return a url, thhrough which you can know whether you successfully publish the draft. Status of the request can also be tracked through the [Mailing List Archive](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-tr-notifications/). You can also use W3C API [as described in the Echidna documentation](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki/How-to-use-Echidna). Note that on Windows, this will give an error about failing to delete a temporary file because it is in use by a different process. This error is harmless; it happens after the submission has completed.\n\nIf the publication through the process is unsuccessful, it's likely because of [Specbreus](https://github.com/w3c/specberus), a spec compliance checker. Echidna automatically runs through Specbreus and will reject the publication if any error is reported by Specbreus. You can run your document through [Pubrules](https://www.w3.org/pubrules/) to understand why your document is rejected. You may modify either the index.bs file or the index.html file to ensure compliance. \n\nMore often than not, you will discover the [Pubrules](https://www.w3.org/pubrules/) errors are due to bugs in either Bikeshed or Specbreus. If so, you will have to modify the compiled index.html file to bypass Echidna and use the [manual process](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki/How-to-use-Echidna) to publish. While you are editing the html file to avoid errors, you should also check to ensure the document still renders correctly.  \n\nThe [manual process](https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki/How-to-use-Echidna) requires you to first create a tar file. To create the tar file, you need to first copy the index.html file and rename the copied file as Overview.html. This is because Echidna doesn't recognize index.html. You can then use the following command to create a tar file: \n```\ntar -cvf WD.tar Overview.html image1 image2 image3\n```\n\nThen you can run the following command curl to publish to Echidna (use the command at the same directory as your tar file): \n```\ncurl 'https://labs.w3.org/echidna/api/request' --user '<username>:<password>' -F \"tar=@WD.tar\" -F \"decision=<decisionUrl>\"\n```\n\nFeel free to contact your chair or any W3C staff when you are stucked. Overall info on echidna is here: https://github.com/w3c/echidna/wiki and here https://labs.w3.org/echidna/.\n\n# Taking meeting minutes\n\n* [Scribe instructions from the W3C Guidebook](https://www.w3.org/2008/04/scribe.html)\n* [Alternate instructions from the XML Security WG](https://www.w3.org/2008/xmlsec/Group/Scribe-Instructions.html)\n"

      "description": "<p>We invite you to visit <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://w3c.github.io/mathonwebpages/\">the main site for this Community Group</a> (&lt;https://w3c.github.io/mathonwebpages/&gt;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many technical issues in presenting mathematics in today's Open Web Platform, which has led to the poor access to Mathematics in Web Pages. This is in spite of the existing de jure or de facto standards for authoring mathematics, like MathML, LaTeX, or asciimath, which have been around for a very long time and are widely used by the mathematical and technical communities. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While MathML was supposed to solve the problem of rendering mathematics on the web it lacks in both implementations and general interest from browser vendors. However, in the past decade, many math rendering tools have been pushing math on the web forward using HTML/CSS and SVG. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the identified issues is that, while browser manufacturers have continually improved and extended their HTML and CSS layout engines, the approaches to render mathematics have not been able to align with these improvements. In fact, the current approaches to math layout could be considered to be largely disjoint from the other technologies of OWP. Another key issue, is that exposing (and thus leveraging) semantic information of mathematical and scientific content on the web needs to move towards modern practices and standards instead of being limited to a single solution (MathML). Such information is critical for accessibility, machine-readability, and re-use of mathematical content. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Community Group intends to look at the problems of math on the web in a very bottom-up manner. Experts in this group should identify how the core OWP layout engines, centered around HTML, SVG, and CSS, can be re-used for the purpose of mathematical layout by mapping mathematical entities on top of these, thereby ensuring a much more efficient result, and making use of current and future OWP optimization possibilities. Similarly, experts should work to identify best practices for semantics from the point of view of today's successful solutions. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This work should also reveal where the shortcomings are, from the mathematical layout point of view, in the details of these OWP technologies, and propose improvements and possible additions to these, with the ultimate goal of reaching out to the responsible W3C Working Groups to make these changes. This work may also reveal new technology areas that should be specified and standardized on their own right, for example in the area of Web Accessibility. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ultimate goal is to pave the way for a standard, highly optimized implementation architecture, on top of which mathematical syntaxes, like LaTeX or MathML, may be mapped to provide an efficient display of mathematical formulae. Note that, although this community group will concentrate on mathematics, many other areas, e.g., science and engineering, will benefit from (and factor into) the approach and from the core architecture.</p>\r\n",

      "description": "Existing W3C voice interaction standards such as VoiceXML are based on use cases centered around telephony-based voice systems. The typical interaction style that these standards support is system-initiated directed dialog using grammars to constrain the speech recognizer. In recent years, interaction with voice applications has become much more flexible, with a user-initiated dialog style and significantly fewer constraints on spoken input. \r\n\r\nMany of these new applications take the form of \"virtual assistants\". These include general-purpose assistants (for example, Siri, Cortana, Google Now and Alexa) as well as virtual assistants with specialized domain expertise. The proposed Community Group will collect new use cases for voice interaction, develop requirements for applications such as virtual assistants and explore areas for possible standardization, possibly producing specifications if appropriate. Depending on interest, this exploration could include such topics as (1) discovery of virtual assistants with specific expertise, for example a way to find a virtual assistant that can supply weather information (2) standard formats for statistical language models for speech recognizers (3) standard representations for references to common concepts such as time (4) interoperability for conversational interfaces and (5) work on dialogue management or  ‘workflow' languages . New functionality for existing voice standards can also be a topic of discussion.\r\nSpeech application developers and voice user interface designers should be particularly interested in this group.",

Git package from Cygwin distribution had better not be used. Alternative Git client distribution such as [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) works better when you encounter an issue building the document using Cygwin.\n\nRendering is primarly based on the content of [`validation/td-validation.ttl`](validation/td-validation.ttl).\nAny customization of the rendering should go there. e.g. by defining `sh:order` or `sh:description` triples for the relevant shapes.\n\n## Implementation Report\n\nTo generate the implementation report,\nincluding a list of normative assertions,\nissue the following command:\n```sh\nnpm run report\n```\nA draft implementation report will be generated and output to\n[testing/report.html](testing/report.html)\nwhich will use relative links back up to [index.html](index.html).\nThe input to this process is [index.html](index.html)\n(_not_ `index.html.template`) so make sure to execute `npm run render` first.\n\nFor this to work, the assertions need to \nbe marked up as in the following examples and follow RFC2119 conventions:\n```html\n<span class=\"rfc2119-assertion\" id=\"additional-vocabularies\">\n  A JSON TD MAY contain additional optional vocabularies that are \n  not in the Thing Description core model.\n</span>\n<span class=\"rfc2119-assertion\" id=\"additional-vocabularies-prefix\">\n  Terms from additional optional vocabularies used in a JSON-TD MUST \n  carry a prefix for identification within the key name\n  (e.g., <tt>\"http:header\"</tt>).\n</span>\n```\n\nThe assertions must be marked up as follows:\n* Enclose each assertion in a span.\n* Mark the span with unique id.\n  It is recommended that the section id be followed\n  by a short unique name for the specific assertion.\n* Mark the span with a 'class' attribute set to `rfc2119-assertion`.\n* Include one (and only one) instance of the RFC2119 keywords (MUST, MAY, etc.)\n  in capitals.\nThis markup does not change the rendering; it just clearly indicates\nand uniquely names the assertion.\n\nIt is strongly recommended to make assertions independent of context.\nIn particular, avoid using pronouns or relational expressions\nreferring to previous statements not included in the assertion.\nSuch references can always be replaced with their\nantecendent (\"dereferenced\") without changing the meaning,\nand this is less ambigious anyway.\nFor example, instead of using \"this serialization\", use\n\"a JSON-TD serialization\".\n\nNote that the above rendering process also assigns each\ntable entry a unique ID and these are also listed in the \ntable included in the implementation report.\n\nOther data, e.g. data from test results, test specifications,\nand implementation descriptions, are also needed to complete the \nimplementation report.  See [testing/README.md](testing/README.md)\nfor details.\n"

OpenTrack includes schemas and vocabularies to describe sports, as well as open source software that helps managing that kind of information.\n\nThrough OpenTrack athletics entities around the world (sport clubs, federations, private event organizers, etc.) will be able to open the data contributing towards open data in sports. This will bring new business opportunities to third parties (developers, public bodies, private companies, citizens, academia).\n\nIn order to maximize the impact and adoption of the final proposal, this initiative is supported by [European Athletics](http://www.european-athletics.org) and other [relevant institutions](https://www.w3.org/community/opentrack/participants) of the world of *Data Management* and *Athletics*.\n\nRead the [Charter](https://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/charter.html) for more information about this group.\n\n## What tools?\n\nThe main component of OpenTrack is a set of vocabularies and taxonomies that will help publishers to model and expose information regarding athletics (events, athletes, facilities, results, rankings, and others).\n\nParticipants in this group will contribute with code recipes, libraries, and examples about the use of athletics information.\n\nCurrently, we are working on a **[Conceptual Model and Vocabulary](https://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/spec/model/)** to define Athletics competitions, events, management and participation in an abstract way.\n\n## Formats and standards\n\nAll documents will be written in English and encoded in UTF-8.\n\nSchemas and vocabularies will be aligned with the existing W3C standards, in concrete with the Data on the Web specifications. Although they will be described as abstract vocabularies, they will be also modeled in RDF.\n\n\n## Can I use it?\n\nOf course you can! Unless the piece of software or document listed in this repository has specified an explicit license, everything is under the [W3C Software and Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document). This means that, by default, you have permission to copy, modify, and distribute OpenTrack works, with or without modification, for any purpose and without fee or royalty.\n\n## How can I participate?\n\nEveryone —either W3C Member or not— is invited to [join the W3C OpenTrack CG](https://www.w3.org/community/opentrack/). Just click on the 'join' button, and register with your W3C account (in case you don't have, please [request one](https://www.w3.org/accounts/request). Once you are a group member, you will be subscribed to the [main mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-opentrack/).\n\nIf you have never used Github, please have a look at [this guide on how to use Github at W3C](https://www.w3.org/2006/tools/wiki/Github).\n\n## References\n\n* IOC [ODF](http://odf.olympictech.org/2016-Rio/rio_2016_OG.htm)\n* IPTC [SportsML](https://iptc.org/standards/sportsml-g2/). Vocabularies for sharing content (e.g., news) about sports in general. There are some specific vocabularies for concrete sports. Athletics is missing.\n* BBC [Sport Ontology](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/sport#). Lightweight ontology for publishing data about competitive sports events.\n"

            "text": "## What’s going on here?\n\nService workers are a new browser feature that provide event-driven scripts that run independently of web pages. Unlike other workers, service workers can be shut down at the end of events, note the lack of retained references from documents, and they have access to domain-wide events such as network fetches.\n\nService workers also have scriptable caches. Along with the ability to respond to network requests from certain web pages via script, this provides a way for applications to “go offline”.\n\nService workers are meant to replace the ([oft maligned](http://alistapart.com/article/application-cache-is-a-douchebag)) [HTML5 Application Cache](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#offline). Unlike AppCache, service workers are comprised of scriptable primitives with an extensive use of [Promises](//developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that make it possible for application developers to build URL-friendly, always-available applications in a sane and layered way.\n\nTo understand the design and how you might build apps with service workers, see the [explainer document](explainer.md).\n\n## Spec and API development\n\nFor the nitty-gritty of the API, the draft W3C specifications are authoritative. [Service Workers Nightly](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/) is a living document. [Service Workers 1](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/v1/) is a subset of the nightly version that is advancing toward a W3C Recommendation. For implementers and developers who seek all the latest features, [Service Workers Nightly](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/) is a right document that is constantly reflecting new requirements. For version 1, contributors plan to focus on fixing bugs and resolving compatibility issues without including new features from the nightly version.\n\nSpec development happens via [issues in this repository](https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues). For general discussion, please use the [public-webapps@w3.org mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/) with a `Subject:` prefix of `[service-workers]`.\n\nUpdates to the spec must reference [resolved issues marked `needs spec`](https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+label%3A%22needs+spec%22).\n\nTo make edits to the design, please send pull requests against the Nightly spec on the master branch. We use [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed). So, change `docs/index.bs` and submit it with the corresponding bikesheded `index.html`.\n\n## Examples\n\nThe W3C Web Mobile Group have defined a [series of use-cases where service worker is particularly useful](https://github.com/w3c-webmob/ServiceWorkersDemos). You can help by adding more use cases, draft implementation code, or even working examples once browsers support the required APIs.\n\n\n## About labels and milestones on issues\nThis is to explain how we use labels and milestones to triage the issues. Note: This is a draft, suggestions for improvements are welcomed.\n\n\n### Prioritization\n**enhancement**: is for anything that was assessed as not having any impact on the decisions for the current milestone and can therefore be safely discussed, rejected or prioritized later.\n\n**milestone**: is used to mark issues we agreed to get done in principle by a given revision. For the sake of efficiency, we tend to only focus on the current milestone and leave everything else without specific milestones.\n\n**impacts MVP**: is used to mark issues impacting the “Minimal Viable Product”. The MVP is the minimal scope of API that can solve actual use cases. These issues have the highest priority.\n\n*Risk labels for impacts MVP issues*\n**medium risk**: to further refine the “impacts MVP” issues. It indicates that the issue is moderately complex and that reaching a conclusion might take some time.

This would prevent traces from hitting dead ends when a request\nreaches an un-instrumented service.\n- Once aligned on a header name, we can ask for a CORS exception from the W3C. This would allow\nbrowsers to attach trace IDs to requests and submit tracing data to a distributed tracing service.\n- Loggers can reliably parse trace / span IDs and include them in logs for correlation purposes.\n- Customers can use multiple tracing solutions (Zipkin + New Relic) at the same time and not have\n to worry about propagating two sets of context headers.\n- Frameworks can *bless* access to the trace context even if they prevent access to underlying\nrequest headers, making it available by default.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [Contributing.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.\n\n- [Group participants](https://www.w3.org/2000/09/dbwg/details?group=108594&order=org&public=1)\n- [How to join](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/108594/join)\n- [Royalty-Free Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/108594/status)\n"

Read the [code of conduct][18]\n2. See if your issue is being discussed in the [issues][8], or if your idea is being discussed in the [proposals repo][19].\n3. We will be publishing the minutes from the bi-weekly calls.\n4. You can also join the working group to participate in these discussions.\n\n## Specifications\n\n* [WebXR Device API Specification][1]: Main specification for JavaScript API for accessing VR and AR devices, including sensors and head-mounted displays.\n* [Legacy WebVR API Specification][2]: Legacy WebVR API 1.1 specification for JavaScript API for accessing VR displays. Development of the WebVR API has halted in favor of being replaced the WebXR Device API. Several browsers will continue to support this version of the API in the meantime.\n* [Gamepad API Specification][5]: Introduces a low-level JS API interface for accessing gamepad devices.\n* [Legacy Gamepad Extensions API Specification][6]: Extends the Gamepad API to enable access to more advanced device capabilities.\n\n\n## Relevant Links\n\n* [Immersive Web Community Group][3]\n* [WebXR Device API Specification][1]\n* [Immersive Web Early Adopters Guide][16]\n* [Legacy WebVR API Specification][2]\n* [WebXR Charter][4]\n\n\n## Communication\n\n* [Immersive Web Working Group][17]\n* [Immersive Web Community Group][3]\n* [GitHub issues list: `webxr`][8]\n* [`public-immersive-web` mailing list][20]\n* [Legacy `public-webvr` mailing list archive][7]\n\n## Maintainers\n\nTo generate the spec document (`index.html`) from the `index.bs` [Bikeshed][10] document:\n\n```sh\nmake\n```\n\n\n## Tests\n\nFor normative changes, a corresponding\n[web-platform-tests][11] PR is highly appreciated. Typically,\nboth PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should\nnot be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why\nand if appropriate [file a web-platform-tests issue][12]\nto follow up later. Add the `type:untestable` or `type:missing-coverage` label as appropriate.\n\n\n## License\n\nPer the [`LICENSE.md`](LICENSE.md) file:\n\n> All documents in this Repository are licensed by contributors under the  [W3C Software and Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software).\n\n<!-- Links -->\n[1]: https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/\n[2]: https://immersive-web.github.io/webvr/\n[3]: https://www.w3.org/community/webvr/\n[4]: https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/charter/\n[5]: https://w3c.github.io/gamepad/\n[6]: https://w3c.github.io/gamepad/extensions.html\n[7]: https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webvr/\n[8]: https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr/issues\n[10]: https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed\n[11]: https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt\n[12]: https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/new\n[13]: http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document\n[14]: https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/\n[15]: https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2008/03-bsd-license.html\n[16]: https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-reference/\n[17]: https://w3.org/immersive-web\n[18]: https://immersive-web.github.io/homepage/code-of-conduct.html\n[19]: https://github.com/immersive-web/proposals\n[20]: https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-immersive-web/\n"
