It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.\n\nIn the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.\n\nTask Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.\n\nNothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.\n\n\n## Decency\n\nThe Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).\n\nThe Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.\n"

For implementers and developers who seek a more stable version, [Service Workers 1](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/v1/) is a right document with which the contributors only focus on fixing bugs and resolving compatibility issues.\n\nSpec development happens via [issues in this repository](https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues). For general discussion, please use the [public-webapps@w3.org mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/) with a `Subject:` prefix of `[service-workers]`.\n\nUpdates to the spec must reference [resolved issues marked `needs spec`](https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+label%3A%22needs+spec%22).\n\nTo make edits to the design, please send pull requests against the Nightly spec on the master branch. We use [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed). So, change `docs/index.bs` and submit it with the corresponding bikesheded `index.html`.\n\nFor normative changes, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests) PR is highly appreciated. Typically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why and if appropriate [file an issue](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/new) to follow up later.\n\nContributions to this repository are intended to become part of Recommendation-track documents\ngoverned by the [W3C Patent Policy](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and\n[Software and Document License](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software).

In the commit, please include on a new line,\n<pre>Contributors: +@githubusername1, +@githubusername2, ...</pre>\n\n### Line Wrapping\n\n#### Recommendations\nFormat new text to break each line within 80 characters. If you add a few new words to an existing paragraph, it's OK if that line exceeds 80 characters. If fixing the width means that the next line gets to wide, and so on, it's better to leave it since touching a lot of lines unrelated to the actual fix makes the PR harder to review. We will make automatic re-flows of the document every once in a while.\n\n#### Automatic Formatting\nYou can use [webrtc-respec-ci](https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-respec-ci) to automatically format your code. Note that this script formats the entire document and may change lines that are not part of your original patch. This can make your changes harder to review.\n\n1. Follow the instructions on \"Local use\" to setup the scripts.\n2. Run: ```make -f ../webrtc-respec-ci/Makefile linewrap LINEWRAPLENGTH=80```.\n\n### Pull Request Names\nChoose a name for your PR that would make sense in a change log.  \nExample: Add support for new attribute X on Y (fixes: #123).  \nAvoid: Fix for #123.\n\n### Linked Names\nMake names of interfaces, enums and other identifiers clickable like this ```<code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>```.\n\n### Refactoring: Moving Text\nIf your PR needs to both move a section of text and update it, please do these operations in two separate commits (or even PRs). That will make the review process simpler.\n"

Thank you.\n\n### W3C Legal\nContributions to this repository are intended to become part of Recommendation-track documents governed by the\n[W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and\n[Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents).

In the commit, please include on a new line,\n<pre>Contributors: +@githubusername1, +@githubusername2, ...</pre>\n\n### 80 Characters\nFormat new text to break each line within 80 characters. If you add a few new words to an existing paragraph, it's OK if that line exceeds 80 characters. If fixing the width means that the next line gets to wide, and so on, it's better to leave it since touching a lot of lines unrelated to the actual fix makes the PR harder to review. We will make automatic re-flows of the document every once in a while.\n\n### Pull Request Names\nChoose a name for your PR that would make sense in a change log.  \nExample: Add support for new attribute X on Y (fixes: #123).  \nAvoid: Fix for #123.\n\n### Linked Names\nMake names of interfaces, enums and other identifiers clickable like this ```<code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>```.\n\n### JSEP References\nReference specific sections of JSEP where possible. The syntax looks like this:  \n```<span data-jsep=\"initial-offers initial-answers\">[[!JSEP]]</span>```  \nSection aliases, to be used as data-jsep values, are found in [jsep-mapping/map.json](jsep-mapping/map.json). Information on how to update the map is found in [jsep-mapping/README.md](jsep-mapping/README.md).\n\n### Refactoring: Moving Text\nIf your PR needs to both move a section of text and update it, please do these operations in two separate commits (or even PRs). That will make the review process simpler.\n"
