Please follow them and we will be able to review your PR a lot faster when we don't have to point out style and other non-technical issues. Thank you.\n\n### W3C Legal\nContributions to this repository are intended to become part of Recommendation-track documents governed by the\n[W3C Patent Policy](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and\n[Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents). To bring substantive contributions to specifications, you must either participate\nin the relevant W3C Working Group or make a non-member patent licensing commitment.\n\nIf you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all contributors in the \ncommit message. In the commit, please include on a new line,\n<pre>Contributors: +@githubusername1, +@githubusername2, ...</pre>\n\n### 80 Characters\nFormat new text to break each line within 80 characters. If you add a few new words to an existing paragraph, it's OK if that line exceeds 80 characters. If fixing the width means that the next line gets to wide, and so on, it's better to leave it since touching a lot of lines unrelated to the actual fix makes the PR harder to review. We will make automatic re-flows of the document every once in a while.\n\n### Pull Request Names\nChoose a name for your PR that would make sense in a change log.  \nExample: Add support for new attribute X on Y (fixes: #123).  \nAvoid: Fix for #123.\n\n### Linked Names\nMake names of interfaces, enums and other identifiers clickable like this ```<code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>```.\n\n### JSEP References\nReference specific sections of JSEP where possible. The syntax looks like this:  \n```<span data-jsep=\"initial-offers initial-answers\">[[!JSEP]]</span>```  \nSection aliases, to be used as data-jsep values, are found in [jsep-mapping/map.json](jsep-mapping/map.json). Information on how to update the map is found in [jsep-mapping/README.md](jsep-mapping/README.md).\n\n### Refactoring: Moving Text\nIf your PR needs to both move a section of text and update it, please do these operations in two separate commits (or even PRs). That will make the review process simpler.\n\n### Run Linter on Examples\nIf you have made a lot of changes to the example code snippets it might be a good idea to run the example linter. For instructions, see https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-respec-ci/blob/master/check-examples/README.md\n\n### Style Conventions\n\n**Strings**. Use quotes and enclose in code tags (to distinguish strings literals from quoted prose).\nExample: `<code>\"String literal\"</code>`\n\n**Booleans**. Enclose booleans in code tags (without quotes).\\\nExample: `<code>true</code>`\n\n**Enum Values**. See **Strings**.\n\n**Notes**. Use div tags for notes.\\\nExample: `<div class='note'>FYI</div>`\n\n**Internal Slots**. Use upper camel case (initial upper case letter) with a leading backslash and enclosed by two brackets. The leading backslash prevents the text in double brackets from being interpreted as a reference. If a slot name is very general, like \"Id\", it might be useful to add more information to it to avoid name collisions and make it easier to identify its owning entity. For example, \"Id\" could be extended to \"ComponentId\".\\\nExample (defining): `<dfn>[[\\FooBar]]</dfn>`\\\nExample (referencing): `<a>[[\\FooBar]]</a>`\n\n### Tests\nFor normative changes, a corresponding [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests) PR is highly appreciated. Typically, both PRs will be merged at the same time. Note that a test change that contradicts the spec should not be merged before the corresponding spec change. If testing is not practical, please explain why and if appropriate [file a web-platform-tests issue](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues/new) to follow up later.

Pull Requests should inclue the following information:\n\n; Does it fix a known issue? \n: If so, add `Fix #333, #222` in a line by itself in a comment, which will close the issue\n; Does it relate to a known issue? \n: If so, add a comment like `see also #444, #111`, and preferably an explanation of how it relates.\n: If not, and it is more than merely editorial, please open an issue\n; Known implementation of the change\n; Links to tests for any changed behaviour\n: Ideally these will be in the form of Web-platform-tests but there are things that can require a manual test.\n; Acknowledgements and changelog updates\n: If the issue has been worked on by somebody who is not acknowledged already in the acknolwedgements section,\n please add their name\n: If the change is substantive, i.e. affects conformance, or a significant editorial one, please note it in the changes section\n\n## Licensing and IPR\n\nContributions to this repository are expected to become part of a Recommendation governed by the\n[W3C Patent Policy](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and\n[W3C Software and Document License](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software).

Thank you.\n\n### W3C Legal\nContributions to this repository are intended to become part of Recommendation-track documents governed by the\n[W3C Patent Policy](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/) and\n[Document License](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-documents). To bring substantive contributions to specifications, you must either participate\nin the relevant W3C Working Group or make a non-member patent licensing commitment.\n\nIf you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all contributors in the \ncommit message. In the commit, please include on a new line,\n<pre>Contributors: +@githubusername1, +@githubusername2, ...</pre>\n\n### Line Wrapping\n\n#### Recommendations\nFormat new text to break each line within 80 characters. If you add a few new words to an existing paragraph, it's OK if that line exceeds 80 characters. If fixing the width means that the next line gets to wide, and so on, it's better to leave it since touching a lot of lines unrelated to the actual fix makes the PR harder to review. We will make automatic re-flows of the document every once in a while.\n\n#### Automatic Formatting\nYou can use [webrtc-respec-ci](https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-respec-ci) to automatically format your code. Note that this script formats the entire document and may change lines that are not part of your original patch. This can make your changes harder to review.\n\n1. Follow the instructions on \"Local use\" to setup the scripts.\n2. Run: ```make -f ../webrtc-respec-ci/Makefile linewrap LINEWRAPLENGTH=80```.\n\n### Pull Request Names\nChoose a name for your PR that would make sense in a change log.  \nExample: Add support for new attribute X on Y (fixes: #123).  \nAvoid: Fix for #123.\n\n### Linked Names\nMake names of interfaces, enums and other identifiers clickable like this ```<code><a>MediaStreamTrack</a></code>```.\n\n### Refactoring: Moving Text\nIf your PR needs to both move a section of text and update it, please do these operations in two separate commits (or even PRs). That will make the review process simpler.\n\n### Run Linter on Examples\nIf you have made a lot of changes to the example code snippets it might be a good idea to run the example linter. For instructions, see https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-respec-ci/blob/master/check-examples/README.md\n"
